Writing during this period were Albion W. Tourgée and Charles Chesnutt.  Tourgée was a white civil rights pioneer and lawyer; Chesnutt, an African American author, essayists, and lawyer. Both men corresponded, discussing the social conditions and concerns that had arisen since the Civil War, especially the deep racial divisions that continued despite the end of legalized slavery. Both men saw the writing of fiction as one means of advocating for the equality of black citizens. Religion features prominently in their literary texts, with the nascent Black Church having an actual or implied presence in their works.  As artists with different racial backgrounds, they reveal through their literary art how personal views about racial equality and religion can refracted through one's racial identity.)",
