This course will explore such questions to get a handle on what an event is and how it happens through the themes of love, fate, trauma, absurdity, faith, hope, and revolution. Texts will include literary works by Franz Kafka, Flannery O'Connor, Herman Melville, and Sophocles; films by von Trier and Kieslowski; and critical pieces by Badiou, Freud, and Heidegger.\nRegular discussion posts on the readings, short writing assignments, and two substantive papers.\n\n\n*T SYNC, TH ASYNC",
