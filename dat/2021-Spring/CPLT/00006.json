Working with foundational texts in modern French thought (by figures such as Saussure, Barthes, Derrida, Foucault, Cixous, Lacan, and Fanon) as well as some more contemporary texts (that may include writings by Judith Butler, Barbara Johnson, Hortense Spillers, Donna Haraway, and Cathy Caruth), we will examine how theoretical reflections about language challenge traditional models of subjectivity, the limits of the human, identity, sexual difference, race, power, technology, the law, and historical trauma. Throughout the course, we will look at selected short literary works alongside the theoretical texts to explore how literary theory helps us think critically about the many different kinds of texts that make up our world.\n\n\n*BOTH TTh SYNC",
