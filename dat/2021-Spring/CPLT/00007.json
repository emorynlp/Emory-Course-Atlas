The course will focus on the ability of this artistic media to represent 1) engagement and propaganda of fascism and Catholicism, and resistance to it; 2) manipulation of historical memory, politics, and religion; 3) Spanish religious and political exceptionalism and foreign relations; and 4) the persistence of religiosity and imperial politics. Class discussion will revolve around the ways in which literary authors, philosophers, and filmmakers deploy strategies to represent these thematic referential axes. Emphasis for students registered in CPLT 389W is on theoretical analysis, for those registered in Film 398W is on national / transnational film; and for those registered in REL 385 is on film and religion / religiosity. The resulting interdisciplinary seminar will unfold as a comparative, interactive engagement of these areas of inquiry.\n\n\nGlobal Genres, Local Films: The Transnational Dimensions of Spanish Cinema.
