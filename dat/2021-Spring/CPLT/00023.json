    "class_notes": "\"Animal, Vegetable, Mineral\" | Recent work in the newly established and rapidly expanding interdisciplinary field of animal studies seems to have permanently unsettled the classical philosophical distinction between the 'human' and the 'animal.' This body of work has effectively redefined nonhuman animals as ethical subjects themselves by complicating the distinction between the rational or linguistic 'human' on one hand and the irrational or nonlinguistic 'animal' on the other.\nYet even within the field of animal studies, the ethical status of the inanimate or nonsentient 'plant' as well as the inorganic or nonliving 'stone' remains very contentious. New interdisciplinary fields have begun to emerge; fields with such tentative names as \"critical plant studies\" and \"ecotheory\",  further calling into question the distinction between the 'human' and the 'nonhuman' that the field of animal studies itself has already broached.\nDoes the claim for sentience among plants undermine the ongoing political struggle for animal rights? Does the argument for some kind of agency on the part of stones overturn the very basis of all ethical thought and action? Have the binary oppositions 'rational/irrational' and 'linguistic/nonlinguistic' that serve to define the human being within the classical philosophical tradition simply been replaced by the binary oppositions 'animate/inanimate,' 'sentient/nonsentient,' 'organic/inorganic,' and 'living/nonliving' within the field of animal studies?\n\n\n- Cary Wolfe, Animal Rites: American Culture, the Discourse of Species, and Posthumanist Theory (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003), ISBN 978-0226905143;\n- Matthew Calarco, Zoographies: The Question of the Animal from Heidegger to Derrida (New York: Columbia University Press, 2008), ISBN 978-0231140232;\n- Michael Marder, Plant-Thinking: A Philosophy of Vegetal Life (New York: Columbia University Press, 2013), ISBN 978-0231161251;\n- Jeffrey T.
