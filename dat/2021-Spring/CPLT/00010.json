    "class_notes": "\"Marxism, Literature, Culture\" | This course will focus on the problem of literature and culture in Marxist theory. We will read selected texts by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Mikhail Bakhtin, V.N. Vološinov, Georg Lukács, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Adorno, Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, Raymond Williams, E.P. Thompson, Stuart Hall, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. Although our class discussions and written assignments will be based on our assigned course readings, we may also draw from literature and other cultural forms beyond our assigned readings in order to illustrate their different and sometimes conflicting theoretical approaches. \nStudents will not only learn about these different approaches to literature and culture and their relationship with one another, but they will also learn how to read theoretical texts and write scholarly papers. This course fulfills one of the three elective requirements for the Major Degree in Comparative Literature as well as the General Education Requirement (GER) in Continuing Writing (WRT) for Emory College.\n\n\n- Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Marx-Engels Reader, ed. Robert C. Tucker, 2nd ed. (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1978), ISBN: 978-0393090406\nPlease note that students may be required to purchase additional texts for our assigned course readings.\n\n\n- Four (4) response papers (10% each, 40% total)\n- Long essay (40%)\n- Attendance and participation (20%)\n\n\n*BOTH MW SYNC",
