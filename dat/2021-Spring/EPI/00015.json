Biospecimens have been analyzed to evaluate exposures and health states for decades. We will discuss a range of public health applications of molecular epidemiology. For each, we will review the biospecimen and analyte, how the biospecimen is collected and analyzed, and how the results are used, or may be used, to protect or improve public health. Examples of topics we will study include (a) cholesterol & triglycerides associated with heart disease, (b) blood alcohol & breathalyzer associated with injury, (c) illicit drug screening and employment, and (d) serum -13C as a marker of dietary sweets intake.",
