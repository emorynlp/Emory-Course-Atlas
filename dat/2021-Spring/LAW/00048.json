    "course_description": "This class offers a unique opportunity to transform tension into a strength. By studying traditional mechanisms for enforcing corporate promises and any perceived conflict between addressing racism and climate change at the same time, the study will culminate in the drafting of a model shareholder resolution that integrates race and climate concerns. Highlighting the synergy of pledging to address both climate change and racism through a single, model resolution could be a powerful tool used by corporations in the near future.",
