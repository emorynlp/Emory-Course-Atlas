Steve Jobs said \"Everyone should learn how to code, because it teaches you how to think.\" The course is designed for folks with low-to-no coding background and exposes one to the tools that support other decision making activities. We develop basic skills in Python (data manipulation, string handling, etc) and in web development - HTML/CSS/js (web design) and some will be involved in Java language. In addition, concepts and languages in 3D Printing, augmented reality and game design are explored. Many small projects and a few summary projects are used to demonstrate acquired skills.",
