Our journey will takes us from the influence of groups and social media, to the psychology and neuroscience underlying deception, economic choice, risk, emotional influences, and social and ethical decisions. The goal of this course is to examine both how you currently make your decisions and how a variety of methods will allow you to significantly improve your decision making and problem solving skills.",
