    "course_description": "This course garners \"expert\" wisdom from scholars with distinct disciplinary perspectives who have variously considered the nature and power of human hope and the potential threats to hope faced by marginalized populations and the caregivers who seek to aid them. Young African American men will serve as the primary lens to investigate the problem of threatened hope, muteness, and invisibility. However, care for other unacknowledged groups including, but not limited to the imprisoned, the homeless, and the elderly will be discussed. (Race, Ethnicity, and Gender).",
