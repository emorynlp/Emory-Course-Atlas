How do African writers imagine cultural, economic, and political independence? In what ways do their texts enact forms of independence and interdependence? To what extent does African literature itself depend on publishers and prizes based outside the continent? While our focus will be on English-language fiction, we will also examine essays and poetry in English, as well as film in other languages.)",
