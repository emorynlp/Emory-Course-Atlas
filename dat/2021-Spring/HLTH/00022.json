The study of health communication also includes using linguistic data as a diagnostic tool, development and implementation of healthcare materials, and the recording, retrieval, and interpretation of personal health information. We will examine health communication as a kind of intercultural discourse, in which participants often communicate across various kinds of social, cultural and linguistic barriers, even though these are not always evident to participants themselves.",
