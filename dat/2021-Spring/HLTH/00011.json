This will first require familiarizing ourselves with the major classical approaches to this field (Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Virtue Ethics, Care-ethics, etc.) and then evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each of these approaches for a variety of health care situations. Some topics that will be covered include: patient rights, research ethics, reproductive rights, eugenics, euthanasia, abortion, organ transplants, and inequalities in our health care system.)",
