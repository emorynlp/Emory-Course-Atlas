Social media use positively and negatively impacts our physical, emotional and mental health. In this course we will examine these health impacts, methods of effective communication, and the concept of the authentic self. Concurrently, students will explore methodologies, theories and techniques related to applied theater. They will learn the nuances of effective health messaging, and about how to incorporate those messages into relevant dramatic material for performance. As students gain an understanding of the power of applied theater, they will put theory into practice, creating original scenarios about social media and its impacts on our lives.",
