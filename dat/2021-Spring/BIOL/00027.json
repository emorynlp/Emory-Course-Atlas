In turn, insects harbor microbial symbionts that can detoxify these compounds.  In this lab course, students will work in research teams to explore plant-insect-microbe interactions in the bean beetle model system.  Students will use research techniques from ecology, microbiology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics.  In addition, students will develop skills in experimental design, data analysis, and science communication)\nPrerequisites:  Biology 142 + 142L and permission of instructor.  Contact Dr. Beck at cbeck@emory.edu for permission.  Students must also register for a Biology 386-3 Laboratory, section 4 or 5.",
