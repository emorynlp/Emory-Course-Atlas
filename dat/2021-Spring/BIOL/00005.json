We will focus on the brain systems that allow us to taste and smell and how the chemical, physical, and cultural properties of different foods affect our experience of eating.  The class will meet virtually with occasional in-person socially distanced meets for cooking/tasting.  Grades will be based on written assignments and on classroom participation.  No prior background in neurobiology, chemistry, or cooking is required.
