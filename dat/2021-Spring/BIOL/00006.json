Natural and human-exacerbated disasters, such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, create overwhelming flows of information, demanding that we, as information consumers, recognize tools that bullshitters use and why particular claims are or are not supported by sound scientific evidence.  We will rely primarily on case studies surrounding claims relevant to COVID19 and the book \"Calling Bullshit\" (Bergstrom and West) to discuss the classic and emerging ways in which scientific evidence can be transmuted into BS.",
