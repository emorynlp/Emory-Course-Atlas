Studying social justice movements and struggle in Italy and beyond will help us become more knowledgeable about these issues in order to pursue solutions in our global world. In this class we will go deep into Italy's present social justice movements and make comparisons with social justice movements in the US, globally, and in our own communities. We will study topics such as climate change, #Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, immigration, poverty, Indigenous communities, the LGBTQ movement, Health and Coronavirus, and others.\nBooks: Course reader.",
