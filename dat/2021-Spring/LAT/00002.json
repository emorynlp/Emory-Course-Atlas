    "class_notes": "Content\tAn introduction to Latin poetry through selections from Ovid's Ars Amatoria (\"The Art of Love\"), the poem for which he was supposedly banished from Rome by the emperor Augustus.  The fundamental aims of the course are to increase the students' reading facility in Latin in general and to develop appreciation for Latin poetry, including a basic understanding of meter, in particular.  We shall also consider Ovid's unique style, his parodies of myth, history, and other poetic genres, the possible dangers he posed to Augustan political and moral order, and of course his sense of humor.  Through attention to Book III, the only book of Latin poetry ostensibly addressed to a female audience, we will consider the roles of women and men in Roman society. [Note that the class, scheduled for three days a week, will normally meet synchronously for 50 minutes in those slots; in some weeks it may be necessary to hold only two class meetings, which would then be 75 minutes each in those weeks.]\nTexts\t\tOvid, Ars Amatoria 1, ed.
