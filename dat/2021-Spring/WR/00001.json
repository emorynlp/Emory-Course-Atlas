    "course_description": "This course aims to provide students of all backgrounds and educational levels an introduction to the religious tradition of Islam both as a dynamic system of faith and as a sociohistoric phenomenon. As a survey, this course focuses on the broad parameters of Islam in terms of its relationship to other religious traditions (mainly Judaism and Christianity) and in terms of its internal diversity (e.g. legal, theological, and sectarian division. The goal is to enable students with a basic proficiency of Islam in terms of historical scope, proper terminology, and conceptual approaches, which will allow them to pursue further inquiries into various aspects of the tradition. Most importantly, it will provide students with the ability to critically engage current events and issues as they relate to the religion of Islam and sociopolitical dynamics of the Muslim world.",
