    "course_description": "With its walls razed to ground by Babylon's armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished cities. Some recovered from the destruction, others did not. But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate & enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Working through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, we will study the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center.",
