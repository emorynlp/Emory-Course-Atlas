As we shall see, Laplanche's 'generalized' theory of seduction affirms the primacy of the other against a certain theoretical self-centering, and proposes new understandings of key notions such as: 1) the unconscious and its genesis 2) repression 3) the drives 4) time (the temporality of 'Nachtr√§glichkeit' or 'afterwardsness' in Laplanche's reformulation) 5) gender 6) trauma.\nThe course will be entirely online.\nTexts may include:\nFreud:\n'Aetiology of Hysteria'\n'The Hysterical Proton Pseudos' in Project for a Scientific Psychology\nThree Essays on Sexuality\nLeonardo Da Vinci and a Memory of his Childhood\nLaplanche:\nNew Foundations for Psychoanalysis\nEssays on Otherness [selections]\nFreud and the Sexual [selections]\nLife and Death in Psychoanalysis [selections]\nThe Unconscious and the Id [selections]",
