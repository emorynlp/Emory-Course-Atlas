Email permission to graduate coordinator to enroll: kay.norgard@emory.edu.\n    This graduate seminar explores current ethnographic work on subjective experience and mental well-being in cross-cultural perspective, with a focus on global mental health, selfhood, morality, disability, embodiment, and contemplative practice. This seminar is especially appropriate for, but not limited to, individuals interested in psychological and psychiatric anthropology. In recent years, anthropologists have been increasingly interested in exploring agency and internal subjective experience in addition to and in relation to social, political and economic structures. We will critically engage selected monographs to examine what these authors successfully accomplished from their ethnographic methods and conceptual approaches, and where they encountered limitations and challenges.",
