But what kind of evidence is used to support this view, and can geopolitical interests, cultural traditions, and anxieties exposed by the pandemic affect how evidence is utilized and understood? Why historically has 'mad Russian' been such a common stereotype? And how might Russians themselves question 'reality' or understand 'madness' as an alternative modernity or world-view?\nRussia's history is often associated with 'Mad Russians' like Ivan the Terrible, Rasputin, or Stalin, and this course examines a wide range of materials to examine such figures. From writings by Dostoevsky to statements by leading figures in today's Russia, we will find 'madness' to be a complex and often contested schematic framework functioning not only to challenge but also to manipulate individual, national, and international norms or power hierarchies. As the 'Red Scare' of the Cold War-- which included a range of conspiracy theories--Russia looms large in discussions about global politics today. Our seminar will explore key issues in Russia's past to the present, including the role of psychology and psychiatry, relationships between ideology and propaganda, and 'madness' as metaphor for environmental concerns and for political, cultural, racial, and social dissent. This seminar is 'evidence'-based, and discussions draw on interdisciplinary and multi-media materials.",
