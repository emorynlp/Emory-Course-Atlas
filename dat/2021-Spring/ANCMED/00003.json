In this class, we investigate the fundamental highlights and transformations within the Greek visual arts and material culture from the emergence of communities in the early Iron Age to the Hellenistic world launched by Alexander the Great. Key themes include the decision to make the human form in imitation of nature; to invent systems of columnar architecture constructed with submillimeter accuracy; to decorate precious, mundane, and monumental objects with mythological creatures and heroic narratives; and to build urban and sacred environments that exploited the natural grandeur of the rugged terrain. We will work across media ranging from clay and thatch to marble, gold, and ivory. Throughout, we will focus on how recent archaeological discoveries are transforming our understanding of the Greek world.\nThe course will consist of lectures, discussions, case studies, and projects. Students will gain hands-on experience working with ancient Greek objects in the Carlos Museum.\nArt History major/minor: Division I \nArchitectural Studies minor: elective",
