    "course_description": "This course will study the \"nancial markets\" and the \"nancial intermediaries\" that make the markets operate. Attention will be given to both the short-term money markets and the long-term capital markets (\"bonds\" and \"stocks\") as a source of more permanent financing. Among the institutions examined will be securities brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, and investment companies and partnerships. A natural extension of the study of institutions is a discussion of the role of central banks and their conduct of monetary policy. Lastly the course will look at financial innovation in the markets and the occurrence of financial crises.",
