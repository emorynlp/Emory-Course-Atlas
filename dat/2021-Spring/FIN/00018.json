Using the fundamental pricing technique and the valuation models derived from this technique, various extensions and applications will be examined. These will primarily be equity-based, though some fixed-income products will be analyzed. The perspective of both the derivatives dealer and the end-user of derivative products will be taken, the latter including hedgers, speculators, and arbitrageurs. Securities from the exchange-traded and over-the-counter markets will be examined. The topics covered include financial engineering, structuring, and product design, numerical methods (e.g. Monte Carlo simulation) and the mathematics of derivatives pricing.",
