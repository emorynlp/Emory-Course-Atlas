It familiarizes students with the social, philosophical, and religious environment in which early Christianity emerged and within which the language of the NT may be interpreted. Although the subject of the course is the Greco-Roman world itself, the cateogories and questions studied are formulated with an eye to what is useful or important for the interpretation of the NT.",
