They will study models and case histories of literary journal production, and editorial ethics. They will develop practical skills in close reading, practical criticism, editing, use of submission management software, and publication design. They will read, discuss, argue, deliberate over, and reject or accept works submitted by writers from all over the world. Editors assigned to specific texts will engage with writers in real-time, deadline-driven problem-solving as they seek to sharpen the poems, stories, and essays they have accepted. Their 380 will make concrete their team's editorial vision.",
