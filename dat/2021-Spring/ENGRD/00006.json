Students in Writing for Games explore that question by playing narrative-focused games and interactive stories, reading critical and technical literature about mechanics and story structure in interactive fiction, and experimenting with our own writing. We also explore how different authors and authorship systems use interactive mechanics to further traditional goals of storytelling like communication, engagement, and empathy.",
