How do colonial formations influence postcolonial identities? In a rapidly globalizing world, what place do national identities have, if any? How do we define 'traditional' and 'modern' in a time of fluid identities? How are these ideas of tradition gendered and why? As you examine characters, motivations, and themes, don't forget to bring the lesson home, and ask yourself, how does history write you as a subject in this world?)\n(Requirements: Canvas posts for every class meeting, presentation, formal expository paper.)",
