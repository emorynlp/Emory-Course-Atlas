We will read these texts in relation to historical texts and contexts as well as contemporary concerns. We will also regularly engage Native news media sources. How are Indigenous women's bodies sites of colonization, assimilation, and appropriation but also sites of resistance, healing, and empowerment? How do Native women writers deploy a diverse array of literary styles and techniques? And what can we all learn by centering the experiences and voices of Native American women?)",
