Attuning our readings to the sonic descriptions and elements embedded within African American and diasporic textual production from the slave narrative tradition forward, we will interrogate multifarious politics of sounding and listening across the terrains of race, gender, sexuality, and attend to concerns of nation and diaspora, in order to examine the ways in which African diasporic thinkers have leveraged sound within their textual productions. We will further consider what political urgencies lie within, and are represented through sound to assess what novel theorizations of race, time, space, trauma, memory, intersubjective relations, and 'freedom' might be gleaned from close-listening to these bodies of literature.)",
