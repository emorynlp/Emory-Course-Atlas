Both renowned authors grapple in their works with some of the most persistent questions and intransigent issues in American life concerning Blackness, gender, sexuality, and the meaning(s) of freedom and unfreedom. Over the course of the semester, we will investigate how each author aesthetically represents concerns of race, gender, sexuality, politics, religion, personhood and the shifting meanings of freedom through comparative readings of their novels, stories, plays, essays and speeches.)",
