Special emphasis will be placed upon ongoing colonialisms that fomented mass Latinx migration to the U.S. via the Mexican Revolution, Operation Bootstrap, WWI, WWII, the Cuban Revolution, and U.S. backed wars in Central and Latin America. Providing students with a historical grounding in the literary production of Latinx populations, we will examine the formation of a canon by taking up the question of form - novel, short story, poetry, plays, performance art, visual culture, memoir, and social media).",
