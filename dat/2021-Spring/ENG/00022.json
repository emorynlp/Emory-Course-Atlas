    "class_notes": "(This course will introduce students to the intricate, wisdom-rich fiction of the British Victorian period, 1837-1901. The class will focus on ways that Victorian writers represented sensory experiences in changing urban and rural environments, but this approach will open many related issues. Students will examine some extraordinary novels in light of social developments such as colonialism, rapid urban and industrial growth, labor movements, changing understandings of masculinity and femininity, and the shifting roles of science and religion. At the same time, students will analyze the ways that novels function as works of art and learn how artworks can shape the societies that produce them. Students will be required to complete analytical and creative assignments to be chosen from a range of topics. These assignments will emphasize the ways that critical and creative thinking can work together to build literary knowledge. No expertise in literary or creative writing will be assumed, and this is not a creative writing course. The class is recommended for students who passionately love to read. The reading assignments will be demanding, but the course offers the opportunity to read fascinating, unforgettable stories. Among the authors whose works we will analyze are Emily BrontÃ«, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, Robert Louis Stevenson, Anthony Trollope, and H. G. Wells. There will be no midterm or final exam.)",
