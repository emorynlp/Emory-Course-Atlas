We will explore both cultural movements as they intersected with the 20th-century Black freedom struggles, and we will interrogate the scholarly constructions of these movements as literary history. We will study key figures of each movement, including Zora Neale Hurston, Hubert Harrison, Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Douglas Turner Ward through their poetry, drama, essay, fiction, music, and visual art.)",
