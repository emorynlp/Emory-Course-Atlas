The other course content will be delivered asynchronously)\n(This course responds to our current global crisis through poetry.  It springs from a lockdown initiative to share a poem a day chosen by students and faculty in Emory's English department.  Using these poems as an unofficial anthology for the class, we will discuss the role of poetry in our contemporary moment.  In this time of great unrest, uncertainty, and upheaval, what can we ask of a poem? Poetry has always been a site of consolation, but also of protest. Do we turn to poetry as a source of comfort or warning? Does it inspire anger or hope? In what ways do familiar lines take on new resonance in our current crises?)",
