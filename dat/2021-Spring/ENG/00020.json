We will adopt a broadly historicist approach, devoting special attention to the relation between the period's literature and the politics of the English Civil War (1642-1651). This approach, however, will not be at the expense of attention to the formal and thematic qualities of individual works. Areas and themes covered in the course will include metaphysical and cavalier Poetry, Jacobean drama, gender relations in the seventeenth century, empiricism and science, the English Civil War, and the poetry of John Milton.)",
