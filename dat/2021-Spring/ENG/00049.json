    "class_notes": "(In his discussion of racialized sexuality as a product of 'stereotypic, symbolizing, and condensing discursivity,' Abdul JanMohamed suggests that: it is the hystericized, over-sexualized body of the black male that is used by the discourse of racialized sexuality to reinforce the hysterical boundaries between the two racialized communities ('Sexuality,' 105,6). The 'open secret' of the white master's desire for the female sexual slave, on the other hand, is characterized by a 'peculiar silence' (104, 94). How does racialized sexuality constitute subjects and identities? This course investigates sexual/textual empires through the scenes of interracial desire, colonial masculinity, postcolonial/queer intersections, carceral sterilization, and visions of trans futures. We will read short stories and novels (including twitterature) by African, Asian, Black British, and American authors likely to be drawn from this list: authors such as Adichie, Dangarembga, Devi, Egan, Evaristo, Levy, Lahiri, Roy, and Rushdie.)",
