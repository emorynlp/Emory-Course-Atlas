    "course_description": "This is a required course for Environmental Health and Global Environmental Health students in their final spring semester who are completing a capstone project for their integrative learning experience (ILE). The course provides a productive, supportive and critical environment for the completion of capstone projects. In addition, the course prepares students, using their capstone project as a platform, with skills needed for successful careers in environmental health. Students will identify topics of interest, engage with scholars and literature on their topic, and through a series of written, poster, and oral presentations, make an original, substantive contribution to the field. Environmental health skills gained during the EH and GEH programs are applied and integrated, including critical thinking on methodological and policy issues surrounding the topical issues presented; effective communication strategies for complex environmental health topics; and applying environmental health theory and principles to practical public health situations and professional practice. Further, students will critically review each other's work with an emphasis on methodological understanding, appropriate assessment of applied and research needs posed by the topic, intended audience, communication methods, and policy concerns.",
