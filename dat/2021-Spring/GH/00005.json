The course covers topics around identifying and appraising the evidence base, assessing and addressing barriers that impede implementation of proven interventions, designing innovative solutions and studies to test these, and concepts of decision science to promote implementation and sustainability of proven interventions.  Throughout the course, students are exposed to case studies of global health interventions which illustrate implementation science concepts while evoking discussion and critical thinking.\n\"",
