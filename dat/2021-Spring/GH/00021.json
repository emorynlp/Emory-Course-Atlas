The need for a multidisciplinary approach will be emphasized and vision loss makes a good model for other public health problems, especially non-communicable diseases. Reading from literature (available online to Emory students) will be assigned daily. Teaching methods will be a mix of didactic lectures by faculty, cases studies for discussion, and student presentations. All students will be expected to use suggested reading materials to prepare short presentations on specific topics for the class.",
