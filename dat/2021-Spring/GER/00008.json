While German culture has produced major schools of rational and scientific thought (from enlightenment philosophy to modern physics), German-language literature has also often ventured beyond scientific rationality and explored worlds of dreams, fantasy, and the supernatural. This course will focus on 'fantastic' short stories and novellas from the Romantic era to the present, and consider how authors have imagined strange, alternate worlds as a response to culture and society of their time.",
