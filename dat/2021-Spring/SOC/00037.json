Although the vast majority of sociological research has focused on race within the U.S. context, a comparative lens allows us to contextualize the U.S. experience by drawing on an increasingly global literature. We will compare and contrast the ways race, ethnicity, and colorism function in different societies. This is a reading course, not a research seminar. We will discuss key theoretical and empirically-based readings in the literature on race, ethnicity, and colorism.",
