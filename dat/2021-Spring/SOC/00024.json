These processes mark certain bodies as suspect or outsiders, but the white male body remains the unmarked somatic norm (Mills. 1997: 53). As such, it only has the natural right to freely navigate public spaces without the presumptions to which other bodies are subject. Razack (2002: 15) notes, \"To interrogate bodies travelling in space is to engage in complex historical mapping; [and] tracking of multiple systems of domination.\" This course examines historical and contemporary processes of spatial and social exclusion. In so doing, this class will ask students to analyze: What can expectations about bodies, space, place, and belonging tell us about the ways racism is perpetuated? What historical, social, and political processes and/or practices influence the perception of being a body out of place? What impact (if any) do these continuing historical, social, and political processes and practices have on contemporary race relations?)",
