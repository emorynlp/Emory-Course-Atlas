    "class_notes": "In this course, we will apply sociological theories to examine paths that lead social inequities to health disparities and how poor health, in turn, can reinforce social disadvantage. Our readings and discussions will cover how inequities cycle between health and social status, which creates a system of injustice that can echo throughout the life-course and across generations. The course is organized by dimensions of social inequality, social capital, education, gender, social networks, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and the life-course. Each dimension is vastly complex and is worthy of numerous years of study. This semester-long course aims to introduce you to the major themes, theories, and empirical findings in inequality and health. Throughout the semester, we will practice applying sociological tools to real-life situations. We will explore how social standing affected health outcomes during notable events such as pandemics, natural disasters, and policy changes.",
