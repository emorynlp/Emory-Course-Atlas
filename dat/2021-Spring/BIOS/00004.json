The course covers statistical methodology for the analysis of continuous outcome data, primarily from cross-sectional studies and designed experiments. We introduce the key matrix-based methods for estimation and inference based on the multiple linear regression model. Subsequently, topics include secondary hypothesis testing and restrictions, regression diagnostics, model selection, confounding and interaction, analysis of variance and covariance, and an introduction to random effects modeling. Students will also be introduced to logistic regression modeling for binary outcome data.",
