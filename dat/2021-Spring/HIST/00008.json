A major theme of the seminar will be understanding the contemporaneous emergence and continued success of Hippocratic medicine and Asclepian religion/cult, two distinct but related ways of thinking about health and healing.  Emphasis will be on primary sources, both texts such as Hippocratic writings and testimonia of Asclepius' healing, and on archaeological and material evidence from the sanctuaries of Asclepius located throughout the Greek world.",
