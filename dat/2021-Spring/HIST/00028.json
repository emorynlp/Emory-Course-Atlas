    "class_notes": "The industrial revolution began in Britain in the late 1700s and transformed the world over the next 200 years.  It involved a set of changes in manufacturing that led to astonishing increases in wealth and productivity, enabling great improvements in most aspects of human life, but it came at the price of profound social dislocation, environmental damage, and political upheaval.  Students in this course will learn about how these interlocking changes came about, with an emphasis on developments in Britain and the United States but with visits to Europe, the Soviet Union, Japan, and China.  Lectures will be asynchronous.  Two discussion meetings each week will be synchronous.  Other requirements include one midterm, three papers, and a final exam.",
    "course_description": "Humanity has become more productive, wealthier, and healthier than ever before in the last 250 years. Many of these achievements can be traced to the industrial revolution, which began in Britain, spread to Western Europe and the United States, and now is being emulated through much of the world.",
