We will explore the nature of Napoleonic rule itself, in France and beyond, as well as such other central themes as the rise of nationalism and romanticism in politics and culture, the experience of soldiers and civilians in an age of intensified warfare, problems of collaboration and resistance in occupied lands, and questions of the revolutionary and modernizing legacies of Napoleon: man and myth.    \nAssignments will include active discussion and participation, a short essay (4-5 pages), a book review and presentation (5-6 pages), and two short reading analyses (1-2 pages each).",
