When is acquiring a new identity permissible and commendable? When is it dangerous and subversive? Who decides? Have some shiftings: perhaps social and economic? \"been taken as more legitimate than others\" say across racial, ethnic, and gender thresholds? Why? \nUnder the broad flag of 'passing,' this seminar will explore such questions as they unfolded in America from colonial times to roughly the present. Materials for the course will include primary and secondary sources, fiction and non-fiction, texts, images, and films.)",
