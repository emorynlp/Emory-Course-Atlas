Special attention will be given to the cultural and religious diversity of medieval Europe and European involvement in the Mediterranean through the crusades, conquest, and trade. The history of Muslim-Christian relations in this region meant that contact facilitated the spread of ideas, food, technology, art, and architecture. We will study cross-cultural encounters through pilgrimage, slavery, and commercial networks that had an effect on Western European society. Other highlights of the course include monasticism, movements of religious reform, heresy, the controversy over marriage, feudal society, and peasant, university, and courtly life.)",
