Topics include: the relationship between slavery and immigration; the rise of nativism as a political movement in the 19th and 20th centuries; the impact of racism and racial categorization on immigration policy; the emergence and development of federal immigration law and immigration restriction; the role of immigration in American political economy and labor relations;  changing refugee and asylum policies; the intersection of immigration and public health concerns; and the politics of illegal immigration and undocumented immigrants in the U.S.\nCourse requirements include regular preparation and participation, facilitating one discussion, one short review essay, and a final original research paper. In addition to the books listed for purchase, several articles will be available electronically.",
