It provides a historical framework through which issues in contemporary Muslim societies in Africa can be analyzed and understood. It is designed to provide students with broad understanding of the history of Islam in Africa, including Northern, Western, and Eastern regions of the continent, stressing the role of the Sahara as a connective space. We will examine the dynamics of the rise and fall of different dynasties and empires, and the way African societies adopted Islam (Islamizing Africa), and adapted to it, maintaining their core traditions and beliefs (Africanizing Islam). We will learn about reform and Jihad movements before examining colonial powers; strategies to conquer and colonize Islamic institutions and societies. During the course we will discuss independence movements and the different ways Islam is being integrated in the fabrics of the independent states and societies, and examine issues of irredentism and terrorism, among others. Together we will analyze the ways opposing binaries, such as continuities/discontinuities, integration/separation, tradition/modernity, etc. apply or not to African Muslim societies and states.",
