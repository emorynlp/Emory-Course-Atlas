We will then focus on the Jewish role in the development of capitalism, critiquing 'essentialist' approaches to this question.  We will explore the Jewish revolt against capitalism in the form of socialism, communism, and labor Zionism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Eastern Europe, America, and Palestine.   We will use economic history as a lens to better understand modern anti-Semitism, mass migration, the project of Zionism, and the rise of international Jewish philanthropy.  At the end of the course, we will look at how capitalism has reshaped Jewish religious culture, from food consumption to liturgical music.  Overall, the course will challenge students to explore a subject long riddled with stereotypes, antisemitism, and triumphalist narratives of a minority success story in the modern world.",
