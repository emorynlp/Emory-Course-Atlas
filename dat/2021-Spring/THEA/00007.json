This course begins with the dramatic literature of Europe and the United States as a core sample from which to discern and evaluate plot, character, theme, structure, language, as well as the pleasures and communications of performance and visual and sonic design. Although it is a fundamental study for majors and minors in theater and playwriting, the course welcomes students of all backgrounds and disciplines.",
