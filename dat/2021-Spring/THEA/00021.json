    "class_notes": "(A cross-disciplinary course that approaches theatrical adaptation through many lenses - both in terms of source material and generative processes. From physical-based devising to more traditional text-based techniques, we will make a series of solo and group adaptations that lead into a piece that is developed, rehearsed, and revised over a longer period of time. We'll look especially at ways to use digital theatre and remote learning to our advantage as essential pillars in the process.)",
