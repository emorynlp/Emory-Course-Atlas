Our main class project this semester will ask 'Whose land are we on?' as we engage in original research asking about relations to land, place, and Indigenous nations and peoples. Students in the class will (a) read/view case studies of theater-makers and other artists who use ethnographic research, (b) learn and practice qualitative research methods, and (c) produce original ethnographic texts and performance pieces based on original research designed and carried out over the semester. Our questions include: How does the ethnographer vividly convey the textures of life? How is analysis integrated with description? What counts as evidence? How is voice, movement, and the body part of ethnography, and part of human experience? What does it mean to take responsibility for someone else's words, write them down, and represent them? How can anthropology move off the written page and onto the performance stage? Course requirements include: short assignments, performances, final paper, and collaborative work/peer review on student projects. Throughout the semester, students will develop skills through interactive performance activities using movement techniques, theater games, and physical theater methods. No prior acting or performance experience is required.)\n(",
