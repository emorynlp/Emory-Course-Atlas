This course, taught in Spanish, explores answers to these questions by presenting students with fundamental concepts of Spanish Linguistics through examination of a brief history of the field of Linguistics, a brief presentation of the sounds of Spanish (phonetics and phonology), the structure of words (morphology), sentence structure (syntax), the study of meaning (semantics and pragmatics) and linguistic variation in the Spanish-speaking world (sociolinguistics, or how speakers vary their use of the system in different contexts and for different purposes). Spanish 304 is a core course of the Spanish & Linguistics Joint Major and a foundational course for the Spanish Major and Minor.)\n(PARTICULARS: No previous study of Linguistics is required. Evaluation is based on active class participation, exams (midterms and a final) and homework assignments.)\n(PREREQUISITE: Spanish 212 or an Official Placement for a FOUNDATIONAL COURSE.
