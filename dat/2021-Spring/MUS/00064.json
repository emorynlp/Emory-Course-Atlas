It involves examination and discussion of a selection of music by the leading jazz musicians of that period, as well as investigation of the relationship between jazz and a host of broader themes, such as civil rights, international politics and diplomacy, the emergence of rock & roll, so-called third-stream music, and women in jazz. We will make extensive use of Emory's subscription to RIPM Jazz Periodicals, a digitized archive of more than 100 jazz journals and magazines published from 1914 to 2010. Each student will write a series of short essays as well as a more extensive research paper.)",
