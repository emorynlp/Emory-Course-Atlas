WRITING SAMPLE MAY BE REQUIRED: If you have not taken ENGCW 271W Introduction to Poetry Writing with Professor Christle, then you must provide a 3-4 poem writing sample (each poem on its own page), attached to the application as one document. An intermediate, intensive workshop in which you will read, discuss, create, revise, and otherwise experience an abundance of poetry. We will seek to notice connections between the language and ideas of poetry and those of the worlds we inhabit. Together we will develop and expand a shared vocabulary in which poems can be made, read, investigated, furthered, and enjoyed. The course will meet synchronously on Thursdays through Zoom. Students will work an additional 75 minutes asynchronously per week. The ability to participate fully in synchronous meetings and in asynchronous components, including audio or video recording (mostly on Canvas) is required. Some activities will require a printer. The use of Microsoft Word is highly recommended.",
