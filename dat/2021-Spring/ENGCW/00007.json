WRITING SAMPLE REQUIRED if you have not taken Intermediate Poetry with Professor Brown: Attach 3-4 poems (each on its own page) to application and submit as ONE WORD DOCUMENT. NOTE: Students (including students on the waiting list) MUST attend the first class session or you will not be allowed to take this class. In this course, we will discuss student poems in a workshop environment while examining contemporary poetry collections and several essays that can provide models for exercises and for new work. As there is a profound relationship between reading poetry and writing it, we will read, discuss, and even recite the work of several poets whose example might lead us to a further honing of our craft. In each workshop, we will read and discuss students' poems in order to examine the relationships between the poet's intentions and ideas and the phrases and images used to embody them. As poetry always has, this course deals with material meant for mature audiences and adult discussion. Students who do not wish to think or study, should reconsider their enrollment in this one. Ten poems are due in the final portfolio.",
