It meets for two synchronous 75-minute sessions per week on MW.\nTopic Title: The Holocaust in the Courtroom: A Legal and Historical Analysis\nThis course satisfies the new Religion major requirement:- Tradition-Judaism, Theme. \nThis course will focus on the way in which the Holocaust has fared in the courtroom particularly in terms of laws against genocide and crimes against humanity.  We will approach the issue from both a legal and a historical perspective.  Is the courtroom the right place to adjudicate matters of genocide? \n Can it serve justice when the topic is Holocaust denial: Special attention will be given to the Nuremberg Tribunals (1945-7),  the Eichmann Trial (1961), Auschwitz Frankfurt Trial (1963),  Zundel Trial (1985, 1988), Irving v. Lipstadt (2000) and the Demjanjuk Trials (1988, 1998, 2009).   Students will be expected to write papers on some aspect of the treatment of genocide in the courtroom, whether the topic has been covered in class or not.",
