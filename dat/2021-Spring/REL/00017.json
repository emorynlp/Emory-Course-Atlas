In this course, we will examine the reasons for these changes, and explore the emergence and development of Reform, Conservative, Orthodox and other Judaisms as well as Zionism. The last month will focus on recent trends in American religion and their impact on 21st-century Jewish life and self-understanding, with a particular focus on learning to interpret and contextualize current events in contemporary media.",
