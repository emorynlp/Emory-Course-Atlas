It meets for two synchronous 75-minute sessions per week on MW.\nThis course satisfies the Religion major requirement:- Tradition-Christianity, Region.  \nNot your typical American religious history course. We'll go far beyond churches and mosques, religious traditions and sacred scriptures, in this exploration of religious cultures. Our focus will be on notions of the sacred, power and pleasures, centers and peripheries, boundaries and the transgression of boundaries. A central thread throughout will be how religious sensibilities shape ideas about human differences, and more specifically how religion and racism are intimately linked in American cultures.",
