It meets for one synchronous session per week on Wednesdays.\nThis course satisfies the new Religion major requirement:- Theme.\nThis 2-credit course introduces students to the wide range of topics, themes, and approaches to the study of religion at Emory. Students will be treated to a lecture by some of Emory's many scholars of religion. Students will get a taste of the plethora of methods used by these scholars, including literary, historical, philosophical, anthropological, art historical, cultural, and sociological approaches. Topics will cover religious traditions such as Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, and Taoism. Themes include gender, sexuality, race, ethics, or media. \nEach class session consists of the guest speaker's lecture, followed by a moderated discussion. Prior to class, students will read an accessible article or chapter provided by the guest speaker, and post a 200-300 word response to this reading. After class, students will post a second response, responding to the lecture and discussion. There are no exams and no final paper project. Passing the course requires attending all the classes and doing all the postings. Lectures will be recorded in case of illness, but all students are strongly encouraged to attend in real time.",
