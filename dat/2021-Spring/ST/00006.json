    "course_description": "This course examines practices of Christian witness in the public sphere and explores how those practices both express and cultivate specific political theologies. Students will build their theological vocabulary through fundamental engagement with concepts such as politics, justice, power and movement and will test that vocabulary by applying it to the concrete practices of organizing. We will conclude by using the tools developed by the course to analyze organizing against mass incarceration in Atlanta and the Southeast United States.",
