Students refine their grammar usage through continued review of basic structures and study of complex structures, and they expand their spoken Spanish skills through discussion and analysis of cultural topics, personal experiences, and literary and journalistic texts. Students are provided ample opportunity for focused listening through use of recorded texts (conversations, music, video) and for oral expression through general classroom and small-group discussions and oral reports. Readings in the course focus on both historical and current cultural and social issues in the Hispanic World and conclude with the reading of the novel Tuya by the Argentinean author Claudia Pi√±eiro. Writing is also developed as a communicative endeavor, with emphasis on the preparation of written compositions/reports based on the cultural components of the course.)\n(PREREQUISITE: Spanish 201 or permission of the Director of Placement.)",
