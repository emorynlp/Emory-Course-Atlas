    "class_notes": "CONTENT: In June 2020 the Supreme Court ruled that the section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that outlaws employment discrimination on the basis of sex must be interpreted to also protect gay and transgender people. The whole basis for this ruling was the analysis of the specific language used in the Civil Rights Act, however, how do words convey meaning? How are words:  meaning established and by whom? How does language portray real world situations? This course, taught in Spanish, explores answers to these questions by presenting students with fundamental concepts in Linguistics through a comparison between Spanish and English at different levels: the sounds of languages (phonetics and phonology), the structure of words (morphology), the structure of sentence (syntax) and the study of meaning (semantics and pragmatics). The course also incorporates an introduction to linguistic variation in the Spanish-speaking world, including the Spanish spoken in the US, and how languages evolve and change with time (historical linguistics).\nEvaluation is based on active class participation, exams (two midterms) and homework assignments.\nSpanish/Linguistics 304 is a core course of the Spanish & Linguistics Joint Major and a foundational course for the Spanish Major and Minor.\nPrerequisite: Spanish 212, official placement for foundational courses or permission from instructor.\nhttp://spanport.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/placement/index.html",
