The course is intended for students with previous education in Spanish who need additional review and practice before advancing to the intermediate level. Because class meetings are reserved for hands-on practice in this integrated skills course that strives to develop students: listening, reading, speaking, and writing skills, students are required to study concepts and complete online activities before coming to class. Evaluation is based on timely completion of assigned online activities, end-of-unit projects, exams, and participation. Text Lord, Gillian and Amy Rossomondo.
