    "class_notes": "Description: This course explores the history of the Mexico-U.S. border from colonial notions of boundaries in New Spain through the Mexican-American War and the Mexican Revolution to the twentieth-century concept of 'borderlands' and the present cultural and political tangle of migration, building of walls, globalization, and multiple and fluid borderland spaces, not all located at the official dividing line. Through reading/viewing and discussion of various kinds of texts (crónicas, treaties/government documents, fiction, poetry, music, visual arts, film), students will gain a critical understanding of the ideological, political, and cultural constructions of la frontera. This course also includes Pre-Texts workshops, using texts as a point of departure for our own expressions of border experiences in sessions created and led by students. The class will also engage with 'border spaces' in Atlanta. Texts: Agustín, Ciudades desiertas Anzaldúa, Borderlands Cabeza de Vaca, Naufragios y comentarios Fuentes, La frontera de cristal Nazario, Enrique's Journey Feature films, documentaries, shorts Tratado de Guadalupe Hidalgo, related texts Herrera, Señales que precederán el fin del mundo Short stories, poems, other texts Secondary texts on borders, border histories/experience Pre-requisite: two Foundational Spanish courses (300-318); recommended pre-requisite: SPAN 301W or 302W.
