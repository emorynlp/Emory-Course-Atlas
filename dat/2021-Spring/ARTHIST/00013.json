    "class_notes": "'A Play with Shabby Leftovers': Collage, Assemblage, Photomontage:\nThis course traces collage, assemblage, and photomontage practices in the 20th century and into the 21st century. From the outset, we will establish theoretical models such as the Baudelairean ragpicker, the collector à la Walter Benjamin, or the bricoleur of Claude Lévi-Strauss. Drawing upon texts from the fields of anthropology, economics, literature, philosophy, and psychoanalysis, we will grapple with distinct manifestation of collage and assemblage. Students will be asked to pay particular attention to the economic and social contexts that give meaning to a given artist's choice of materials and means of production. Do such choices respond to post-war destruction, to planned obsolescence in advanced capitalism, or to the impact of globalization on developing nations? Do they express technological optimism or do they underscore the chilling sameness of mass production? Are they turned inward (as a picturing of dreamscapes) or directed outward (as a confrontation with contemporary socio-economic conditions)? The modes of collage and assemblage will be our lenses onto shifting object-subject relations in the modern and postmodern periods.\nThis class is writing-intensive (WRT) and four credit hours.\nArt History major/minor: Division III",
