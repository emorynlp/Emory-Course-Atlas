    "class_notes": "This seminar delves into the material meanings of objects and humans; interactions and experiences with them, exploring the agency of both humans and objects. We explore how humans interact with objects and how objects guide or inspire human experience. We also examine how objects can change, considering possibilities of their life histories as they persist through time and through varying histories of use and reception. The seminar will focus on select cultures in ancient Mesoamerica, but the readings also will address other places in the world in order to offer other theoretical contributions to the seminar's themes.",
