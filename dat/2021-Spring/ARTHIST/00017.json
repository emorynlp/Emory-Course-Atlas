The active process of remembering ensured that deceased Romans lived on and commemoration lies at the very heart of Roman cultural identity.  The seminar will explore the visual language of Roman funerary art, including reliefs, altars, urns, sarcophagi, paintings, and tomb complexes, and the ways in which they create a posthumous identity and memorial afterlife for the deceased.\nArt History major/minor: Division I",
