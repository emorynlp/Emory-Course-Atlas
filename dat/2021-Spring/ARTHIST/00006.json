We will consider the emergence, in Renaissance Italy, of the notion that both artists and art had histories worth telling, and follow through by examining those traditions of intellectual and social history that have shaped the modern field of study. The course will proceed by examining the interactions of painters, sculptors, and architects with important sites of cultural production, including: the Arena of Padua, the domestic and urban spaces of Florence, the Ducal Palaces of Urbino and Mantua, the Vatican, and the confraternal houses of Venice.\nArt History major/minor: Division II\nArchitectural Studies minor: elective",
