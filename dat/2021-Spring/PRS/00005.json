Students will create a digital portfolio of materials such as drafts of proposed policies, fact sheets, Power Point presentations, You Tube videos, and social media messages for the organization to further the adoption or implementation of a policy solution. The capstone experience is intended to provide the student with experience and skills, including working collaboratively with outside organizations, to ultimately lead the transformation of laws and policies to meet the health challenges of the 21st Century. Students will gain an understanding of the public policy-making process; learn to access tools for identification of evidence-based approaches to public health policy development; practice interaction with community-based and governmental organizations around policy matters; and, refine their skills to synthesize scientific and public health policy information into persuasive written and verbal communications with real-world application.",
