    "course_description": "Information security is ultimately about risks and balances. The most secure information system is one that can hardly be used whereas the greater the access given, the more vulnerable the system may be to malicious activities.This course will enable students to put into practice information security and privacy frameworks and controls that will help determine the best balance or risk posture to protect data and individual privacy. Students will learn key provisions of national and state legislation for protecting the privacy of individuals and populations and understand public health's unique role within these regulations. In addition, students will work with different technology layers and associated controls that may be put in place to minimize the risk to institutions and the individual information that they protect.",
