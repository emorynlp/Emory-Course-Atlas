Students will learn to apply data design methodologies that are driven by effective requirements capture and public health program outcomes. The students will utilize standard requirements derivation methods to discover and extract data attributes and the data relationships that support a public health intent, outcome, or knowledge purpose. They will also learn to aggregate, normalize, and integrate data from multiple health and public health sources into relational model structures. Finally, students will learn best practices and methodologies that are used to architect interoperable public health data systems based on use of standard systems architectures.",
