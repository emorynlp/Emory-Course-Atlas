Methods for the construction of these polymers present an interesting contrast, as they are generated using the techniques of both organic chemistry and biological organism expression. The properties of these polymer classes also differ significantly, owing to the unique composition and structure of each, which allows for a comparison of the benefits and limitations of synthetic and biological polymers considering their inherent function.",
