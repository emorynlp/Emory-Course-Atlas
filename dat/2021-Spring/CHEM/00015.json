The second is to prepare students to effectively communicate scientific results via writing.  Lab exercises will span various areas of experimental physical chemistry including kinetics, thermodynamics, and spectroscopy.  Additionally, students will become familiar with some of the data manipulation and visualization tools used in the chemical sciences.  This is a writing-intensive course and students will produce scientific reports and become familiar with the American Chemical Society (ACS) journal article publication process.  Specific emphasis will be placed on the peer-review process and journal article formatting.\n\n\n(Permission Required Prior to Enrollment)",
