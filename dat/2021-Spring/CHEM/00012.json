CHEM 370 is an introductory level quantum mechanics course specially designed for chemistry students. To remove the obstacle faced by many chemistry students in learning quantum mechanics: their unfamiliarity with the required mathematics, this course has detailed treatments of complex numbers, operators, differential equations, and other needed topics. At the end of this course, students will understand the basic principles of quantum mechanics and apply them to master the underlying concepts of electronic structure for atoms and molecules along with rotational, vibrational, and electronic spectroscopy.",
