Chemistry is the central driving force behind biological processes, and chemistry can be used to interrogate these systems as well. Topics will include the modification, evolution, sequencing, and imaging of proteins and nucleic acids. The course will focus on reading and analyzing the primary research literature to understand cutting-edge technologies and evaluate the inherent ambiguity of scientific research. Students will also learn to generate and communicate original research ideas.",
