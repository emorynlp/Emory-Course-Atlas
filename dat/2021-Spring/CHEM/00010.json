    "class_notes": "This online course is an introduction to quantitative analytical techniques, instrumentation, and experimental design. It will bring together concepts from previous lab classes plus new techniques/methods for answering experimental questions that require accurate and precise quantitative results. Students will apply fundamental concepts of molecular properties and chemical equilibria to understanding analytical techniques such as titrimetry, chromatography, and spectroscopy. Students will evaluate methods for sources of error and engage with recent literature on the application of analytical methods to relevant, real-world problems. The course will culminate with students; developing their own experimental question and proposing a quantitative method to answer it.  \nWeekly synchronous meetings will give students the opportunity to engage in discussions with the instructor, TAs, and peers about analytical methods, data interpretation, and experimental design. Weekly pre-lab lectures will be asynchronous.",
