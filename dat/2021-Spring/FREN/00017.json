As we shall see, Laplanche's 'generalized' theory of seduction affirms the primacy of the other against a certain theoretical self-centering, and proposes new understandings of key notions such as: 1) the unconscious and its genesis 2) repression 3) the drives 4) time (the temporality of 'Nachtr√§glichkeit' or 'afterwardsness' in Laplanche's reformulation) 5) gender 6) trauma.  \nThe course will be entirely online.  Taught in English.\nTexts may include: \nFreud:  \n'Aetiology of Hysteria' \n'The Hysterical Proton Pseudos' in Project for a Scientific    Psychology \nThree Essays on Sexuality  \nLeonardo Da Vinci and a Memory of his Childhood  \nLaplanche:  \nNew Foundations for Psychoanalysis \nEssays on Otherness [selections] \nFreud and the Sexual [selections] \nLife and Death in Psychoanalysis [selections] \nThe Unconscious and the Id [selections]",
