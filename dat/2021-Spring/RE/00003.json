This course is designed to help congregational leaders engage specifically theological questions in their communities by focusing on the way in which authority is exercised in the church. As such, it will explore two basic issues: 1) the sorts of attitudes and practices do Christian leaders need to develop in order to \"teach with authority\" in church and society, and 2) how authoritative teaching plays out in concrete questions of the church's self-definition, as exemplified in practices like baptism and the Lord's Supper.",
