The alternate date will only be used if the instructor or school has an emergency that causes one of the regularly scheduled dates to be cancelled (it is not an additional makeup session for a missed class).  Seminar Description:  This seminar will teach you the fundamentals of using Excel to solve problems in business settings.  It is intended for novices only and is not for students with previous finance modeling experience.  The seminar offers an engaging, hands-on format in which 90% of the class consists of students working in small groups, with frequent breaks to review the solution methodology.    The course will cover basic data, simple keyboard shortcuts to make you faster, introduction to pivot tables, simple calculation-checking techniques, market sizing techniques to estimate market share and breakeven analysis, adding and subtracting dates and times to build forecast models and simple forecasting techniques. \n     This course is recommended for students who want a basic grounding and do not yet have Excel experience.  Students may take this seminar either as a standalone or as a precursor to the Intermediate seminar that the same instructor will offer subsequently in the semester.  The instructor reserves the right to remove students with banking or other modeling experience or expertise.",
