Seminar Description:  The subscription economy is changing business as we know it. The idea behind it is that customers are happier subscribing to the products and services they want, when they want them, rather than purchasing them with the burden of ownership.      This new business model is transforming the customer value economics and necessitates a new approach to retaining customers and subscribers over time. This new practice is called Customer Success and it redefines the way companies interact and serve customers leveraging new methodologies designed to maximize customer value and overall success.\nCustomer Success encompasses all customer touch points, all the way from pre-sales experiences to on-boarding, training and support and ongoing success.      This seminar will provide practical strategies to design, plan, execute and measure a Customer Success organization within a subscription-based business. It will cover topics such as designing the customer journey, customer success metrics, organizational structures, required skills and best practices.",
