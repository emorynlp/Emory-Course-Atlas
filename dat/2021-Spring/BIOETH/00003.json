In 1946-1947, an international tribunal accused dozens of Nazi doctors of war crimes and crimes against humanity for performing not just illegal medicine but unethical medicine in wartime camps, communities and clinics.  From the ashes of such immoral medicine emerged what is now known as the Nuremberg Code.  This course situates Nazi biomedical science of applied biology in historical and ethical contexts, including its relation to American medicine and culture, to better understand the ethics of justifying (that) science, the \"Doctors- Trial,\" and the significance of the Nuremberg Code itself.",
