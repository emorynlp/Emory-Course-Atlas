The course is designed to place ethnomusicological, theological, historical, sociological understandings and worship practices into dialogue. By engaging with these disciplines and exploring the musical and ritual practices students will be exposed to larger social processes such as globalization, sacralization, & secularization in relation to Pentecostalism.",
