It meets for two synchronous 75-minute sessions per week on MW.\nThis course satisfies the new Religion major requirement:- Theme. \nMemoirs are both documents of a history lived and (re)constructions of that experience remembered. Films are the filmmakers perception of that experience. Taking Holocaust memoirs and films as the focus of our inquiry, we will examine: What it means for a text about the Holocaust to be both a historical document and a personal narrative. What it means for a film to depict an event of such seminal importance? How far can the filmmaker go in fictionalizing the event?) (We will consider the relationship between experience, historical fact, and memory; the distinctions between \"truth\" and \"reality.\" And we will compare the mediums of film and the written word.",
