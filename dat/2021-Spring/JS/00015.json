This course investigates how the 1929 political and economic crisis was perceived by representatives of early critical theory and intellectuals of Jewish origin during Germany's first democracy, the Weimar Republic. How did the crisis influence the thinking of such intellectuals as Siegfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, and Max Horkheimer? What new concepts did it inspire and in what ways did it allow for new configurations in philosophy, literary and film criticism? We will examine how the relationship of these three to Judaism is changing and, if so, what role concepts from Jewish traditions play in their perception of the crisis. Course requirements include three response papers of five pages each.",
