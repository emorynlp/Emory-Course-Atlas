    "course_description": "The Leadership Development course is intended to help you focus on the leadership demands that you will likely face as you move into managerial roles within corporations, mid-sized companies, professional services firms or large, public sector organizations. It is becoming increasingly clear that effective managers and executives demonstrate both business acumen and people acumen. This course concentrates on the latter - developing your skills as a leader and as a follower. The course is designed to enhance your understanding of self, best practices in leadership behaviors, and how to bring out the leadership potential in those around you.",
