Does it help create more freedom and pleasure for everyone? Should it be censored? Is censorship antifeminist? Students will be introduced to the major debates and discussions about pornography within feminist theory in the US. In keeping with the current scholarship, pornography will be viewed as a broad set of graphic materials pertaining not only to sex acts and gendered bodies, but also to racial and colonial imaginaries.\nThis course will also equip students with the rudimentary tools of visual analysis. What is the work of an image? How does it elicit visceral reactions of interest and/or repulsion? Is pornography a particular kind of image, or are all images pornographic to some extent?\nThe course materials range from academic essays to short stories, poetry, journalistic report, images, music videos and artwork.)",
