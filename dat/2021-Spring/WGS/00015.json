Moving through enslavement, the post-Reconstruction period, and the twentieth century, our class will consider how we might understand American history and culture through Black women's experiences in the criminal justice system. Using cases that include inter- and intra- racial violence, we will read primary and secondary sources, drawing on monographs, trial transcripts, and original press coverage to ultimately obtain a better understanding of citizenship, policing, and justice.)",
