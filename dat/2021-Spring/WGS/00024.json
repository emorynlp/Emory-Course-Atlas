This course will examine how histories of race and colonialism constituted sex/gender/sexuality, both jointly, and later on, as distinct categories. The course will emphasize historical scholarship and the historical grounding of more theoretical scholarship. We will study the colonial governance of sex, environmental and climate-based theories of sex, eugenics, black ungendering in North America, and decolonial approaches to epistemologies of sex.)",
