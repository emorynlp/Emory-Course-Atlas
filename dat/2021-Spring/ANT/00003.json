The United States has the largest prison population in the world and the highest per-capita incarceration rate, and Black communities in the US are disproportionately impacted by this reality. This course will explore the ways that racial, economic, and gender-based inequalities have led to the proliferation of prisons and jails in the United States, and the ways that Black communities have critiqued and organized against the rise of the carceral state.",
