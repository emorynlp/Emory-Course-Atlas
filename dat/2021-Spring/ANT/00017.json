    "class_notes": "This course will provide an opportunity to critically examine issues that arise in the cross-cultural study of mental health and disorder, taking several perspectives. First, we will explore how biomedical psychiatry is a sociocultural construction, looking at how anthropologists have challenged Western notions of mental health and psychiatry. This will allow us to delineate biomedicine's benefits and limitations in how we view, study, and construct mental health. Next, we will situate the biomedical model in cross-cultural perspectives, analyzing how the concept of pathologies are culturally constructed and treated. Finally, we will explore the global mental health movement, traversing the collision of cross-cultural mental health models and humanitarian psychosocial programs for populations affected by trauma. Throughout the course, we will address questions such as: the meaning of mental illness; the global efficacy of psychiatry; and the role of religion in health and healing.",
