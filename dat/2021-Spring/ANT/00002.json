    "class_notes": "How do we understand lives unlike our own?  In this course, we explore different approaches toward exploring and representing lives of people often overlooked or deemed unimportant in conventional terms.   Biographers usually document the lives of major historical figures, famous authors, acclaimed artists, poets, and celebrities.   So who tells stories of \"other lives\"?   And how might they be told?  Drawing on a range of different kinds of texts (including memoir, the novel, ethnography, films and photography), we will explore selected \"other lives\" and examine the techniques that particular authors use in rendering them meaningful. \nThis course will be offered online.   The class will meet synchronously once a week.  Texts, films and other materials will be assigned for students to work with in their own time between the synchronous sessions.  Each week, students will be expected to submit a Course Journal entry that engages particular issues posted on Canvas by the instructor. \nIn completing the course, students will develop critical interpretive skills with respect to written and visual representations of other lives; and they will gain experience in class presentation and discussion.",
