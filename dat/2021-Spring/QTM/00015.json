These include binary, polytomous nominal, categorical ordinal, counted, interval-valued, bounded continuous, censored, and truncated variables. This course discusses statistical methods for analyzing these dependent variables. The class will go through the models, interpretations, and testing for goodness-of-fit with examples so that students can choose the model and do the empirical analysis for various types of dependent variables that can appear in social science research.",
