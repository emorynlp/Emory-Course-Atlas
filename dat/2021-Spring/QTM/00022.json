This course will discuss the design, analysis, and interpretation of introductory and advanced experimental designs. The first part of the course covers the theory and logic of experiments. The second part covers issues and challenges in implementing experiments that deliver on their promises. Topics include: models of potential outcomes, blocking and covariate adjustment, non-compliance, attrition, heterogeneous treatment effects, interference, mediation, and ethics. Assignments will focus on developing practical skills for the implementation of experiments in real research settings.\n\n\n(Permission Required Prior to Enrollment)",
