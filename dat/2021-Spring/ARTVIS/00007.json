Students will gain fluency in using the Adobe Creative Suite software, specifically Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. Research and conceptual interests of design will also be explored, splitting the focus of the semester equally onto both the content and the creation of digital art. \nCourse notes: \nA student subscription to Adobe CC will be necessary for this course and can be purchased for $19.99/mo through the Adobe website. If the subscription cost is a barrier for you but you want to take this class, do not be deterred because there are other options for accessing the software for free including remote use of the Emory's MediaLab. Specifics of how and what to enroll in will be provided by the instructor at the beginning of the semester. \nThis course will meet one day synchronously and will have asynchronous assignments.",
