    "class_notes": "Ancient Philosophy had a major impact upon later ancient and earlier medieval thought as major texts from the works of Plato and Aristotle to Plotinus and Dionysius the Areopagite were translated by Syrian Christians into Arabic and became available, sometimes under different names, to major Islamic and Jewish figures, particularly with Al Kindi and his circle. This course will trace out features of the philosophical heritage, starting with Presocratic philosophy, Plato and Aristotle and culminating with Plotinus and later Neoplatonism. The course will briefly in its final stages point to some major resonances in the thought of Al Kindi, Al Farabi, Ibn Sina, Suhrawardi and others, on the one hand, and Isaac and Ibn Gabirol, on the other.",
