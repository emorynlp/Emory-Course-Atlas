We will explore major historical trends: including the slave trade, colonialism, and the postcolonial political economy - and their impact on contemporary political, economic, and social life. A second major objective of the course is for students to come away with a sense of the profound diversity of social and cultural life on the African continent and an understanding of the complexity of the issues that face African people, individually and as groups, in their daily lives.  Through reading ethnography, fiction, and a variety of other historical and contemporary texts and engaging film and music from the continent, we will encounter a range of perspectives on ethnicity, gender, power, urban and rural life, environment, family, politics, and religion. Additionally, we will examine a range of analytical themes that explore the very lenses and categories through which Africa has been studied and understood - for example: tribe, kinship, tradition - and discuss the implications of using those concepts.)",
