The course will cover topics such as race relations, sub-urbanization, housing, transportation, immigrant communities, and gentrification. Secondary readings will expose you to existing scholarship about the city and allow you to contextualize and understand Atlanta within the broader field of urban history. We will also rely heavily on primary sources such as photography, film, speeches, music, and maps to analyze the myriad forces that shaped and continue to shape Atlanta's history and culture. In light of the current pandemic, we will also consider how we learn about and understand places that we cannot visit in person. The final project for the course will involve independent, interdisciplinary research and the creation of a piece of public scholarship.",
