At first glance, this is a simple question with a simple answer: a human is a person; we are human. When experts from different fields define the human being and the significance of human life in a positive or constructive way, the answers become more complex. By taking an interdisciplinary approach, we will grapple with the question, \"What does it mean to be human?\" Students will consider and reflect upon competing claims from multiple disciplines and learn to appreciate points of both agreement and difference. Students will develop their own answers to this fundamental question, using their own academic pursuits to personally define what it means to be human.",
