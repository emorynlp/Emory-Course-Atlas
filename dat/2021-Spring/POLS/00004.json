As with all comparative politics, as opposed to international relations, emphasis will be placed on domestic and internal politics of different countries. Utilizing a theme of \"Values, Structures, and Outcomes\" students will be taught to think about similarities and differences in the way the world's political systems operate, to ask why this is so, and to determine likely outcomes and consequences.  Students will thus be encouraged throughout the course to draw comparisons between governmental institutions, the political processes involved in these different political systems, and their behavioral and policy outcomes.",
