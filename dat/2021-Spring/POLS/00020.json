The course will examine both quantitative and qualitative methods for analyzing public policies; while some statistical material will be covered, emphasis will be placed on discussion of research strategies, designs, and interpretation of results. Illustrations will be drawn from major evaluation studies from a variety of policy areas including domestic violence, maternal and child health, K-12 education, homelessness, preschool education, community and economic development, workforce development, and welfare reform, among others.",
