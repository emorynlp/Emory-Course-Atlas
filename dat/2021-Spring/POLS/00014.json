We will study how the three levels of American government intersect to address key issues such as infrastructure, healthcare, economic development, and homeland security/disaster preparedness. We will hear directly from current and former elected and appointed officials including City Council members, County Commissioners, State Constitutional Officers and Legislators, Congressional staff, and department and agency leaders representing different levels of government. The course will allow students to hear first-hand from those on the front line and provide a practical overview of the workings of government.",
