(Brain imaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are transforming many areas of psychology by providing a unique new window into mental processes as they unfold in the human brain. This course will explore the methods and findings of structural and functional neuroimaging studies across a variety of psychological topics including memory, emotion, perception, language, mental illness, and social behavior. Relevant findings from studies of neuropsychological patients with focal brain lesions will also be discussed.)",
