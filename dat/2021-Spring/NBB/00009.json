We will explore molecular structure-function relationships that affect neuronal function and thus, behavior. Topics may include the molecular basis of: channel mutations that cause epilepsy, autoimmune conditions, chemical warfare, drug design, and other topics of students, choice. In this online class, we will use case studies and other active-learning activities to drive our exploration of molecular interactions underlying behavior. Assessments will include student presentations, individual and collaborative quizzes, and other assignments. \nPrerequisites: Previous completion of Chem 204 and/or Bio 301 required. NBB301/Bio360 and/or Psych110 strongly recommended.\nTextbook: None",
