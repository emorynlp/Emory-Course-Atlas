The course focuses on models used in estimating health risks, quantification of variabilities and uncertainties in model-based estimates, Benchmark Dose (BMD) modeling for estimating reference doses, physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) modeling for internal exposure estimation, and in vitro assay-based approach for chemical safety assessment. The course is taught at a PhD level and assumes familiarity with basic concepts of risk assessment as taught in EH 524.",
