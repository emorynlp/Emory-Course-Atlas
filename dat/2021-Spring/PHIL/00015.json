    "class_notes": "This course seeks to better articulate how mental health issues disrupt our normative assumptions about human nature and the `good life'. Taught with support from the Mellon Humanities PhD Interventions Project, we will focus on our common perceptions (and misconceptions) about mental health by reading philosophical texts in biomedical ethics, existentialism, phenomenology, feminist theory, critical philosophy of race, and decolonial theory.  Our theoretical engagement will be supplemented with an exploration of mental health care providers, public figures, and community initiatives that focus on destigmatizing and providing better public access to mental health care services on individual, collective, and institutional levels. Students will end the course with their own final project dedicated to further destigmatizing our private and public relationships to mental health and illness.",
