Toward this end, we will read a number of authors, ranging from the Classical Period, through the Medieval era, and into our contemporary epoch, including Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Boethius, Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd, Aquinas, Descartes, Nietzsche, and Sartre. Through this, students will attain a historically informed perspective of our present-day understanding of knowledge, together with the relation between this, the divine, and the role of evidence.",
