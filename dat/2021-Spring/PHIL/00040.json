We begin with a discussion of the cave drawings and paintings from the upper Paleolithic period (specifically in Chauvet Cave) & the claim that the human mind essentially begins with the creation of these images. (To spur discussion, we'll read a short selection from The Sapient Mind: Archaeology Meets Neuroscience.)  We'll then jump to Bergson's theory of the image & brain in his book Matter and Memory, followed by excerpts from Gilles Deleuze's two cinema books, The Movement-Image & The Time-Image, where he argues that \"the cinema: never stops tracing the circuits of the brain\".",
