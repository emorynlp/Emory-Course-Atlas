This course will survey classical philosophical accounts of human nature, or the lack thereof, and read them against the background of modern science.  I this sense, we will read foundational philosophical accounts in light of evidence from biology, psychology, and anthropology, among others.  At the same time, we will reflect on the historical circumstances surrounding the emergence of philosophical and scientific propositions to understand the role that context plays in the development of ideas.  None of these views grew out of a vacuum but were embedded in material and social milieus; part of our task is to recognize the role that social forces play in shaping, justifying, or even distorting our understanding of the human condition.  By the end of the semester, we will be equipped to critically assess both the strengths and limitations of different philosophical views of human nature, and construct a position synthesizing information from several, and sometimes disparate, views.",
    "course_description": "What is distinctive about a human being? What did it mean to be a human in ancient times, as it differs from what it means in modernity? Who are we, and what are our possibilities? What can we become? The responses to these questions affect our ethics, our politics, and the meaning of our lives.",
