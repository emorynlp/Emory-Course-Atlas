This senior seminar will investigate contemporary arguments about free will as shaped by developments in neuroscience. We will review canonical arguments for and against the possibility of agency and follow by investigating the ways in which \"the era of the brain\" has shaped our beliefs about the possibility of free will and moral responsibility. In doing so, we will consider how neuroscientific information (particularly evidence from fMRI studies) has influenced discussions about the possibility of legal responsibility.",
