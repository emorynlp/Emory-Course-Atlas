After reviewing important aspects of the linear model often not covered in Econ 320, natural extensions such Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression will be covered and students will learn to implement them in the R statistical software using data sets relevant to Economics. At the end of the course, students should feel comfortable using Github, LaTeX, and R (various in-class tutorials will be provided, as well as self-training online mini-courses are expected to be completed by students).",
