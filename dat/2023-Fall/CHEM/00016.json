Contemporary concepts including molecular glues, targeted protein degradation, DNA encoded fragment libraries, macrocyclic peptide modalities, proteomics and covalent drugs, and integration of computational chemistry will be discussed. There will be an emphasis on the underlying organic chemistry developments required to develop and implement these approaches.  The class will be based on readings from the primary literature. Students will need a strong working knowledge of organic chemistry and biological chemistry (Chem 203 and 204).",
