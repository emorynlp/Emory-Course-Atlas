Complete course atlas information (including texts and grading) and application form will be available on the Creative Writing Program website: https://creativewriting.emory.edu/index.html\n\n\nThis workshop will introduce the fundamentals of writing personal nonfiction narratives. We will explore the basic elements of storytelling -- character, plot, setting, structure, dialogue, etc. -- and how each is used in creating a story out of the events of one's own life. Students will learn how to turn a true story into a written narrative. Editing skills will be sharpened in discussion and evaluation of one another's works-in-progress. The course will concentrate on the creation of three short nonfiction pieces as well as considerations of technique, creation of real characters, and dramatic structure. Classes will be conducted as workshops in which the main emphasis is on the students' own work, and short lectures, with some in-class writing and improvisation.\n \nPre-requisite: Any 200-level Creative Writing workshop, attach a 5-page writing sample of any genre to your application",
