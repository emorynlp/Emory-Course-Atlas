Complete course atlas information (including texts and grading) and application form will be available on the Creative Writing Program website: https://creativewriting.emory.edu/index.html\n\n\nLiving a life and writing a play have a lot in common.\nIn this class, we will learn to pay attention to the elements of craft in relation to storytelling.\nWe will learn (or remember) how to be astonished and find joy in our work and in the world.\nWe will learn how to tell about it. We will learn how to write plays.\nI don't really believe in teaching you what a play should be, or following mandates on form or process that have historically been made and upheld by a select few.\nI see my job as exposing you to many points of view, many tools, many ways, and guiding you toward the plays you want to write. That only you can write.\nWe will learn to approach writing in the same way we approach something like exercise. Before running a marathon, we must train every day. We must warm up. We must feed ourselves well. In this class, we will learn how to train our writing muscles by doing daily warm-ups and eat the best artistic foods to fuel our own work through engaging with plays, as well as poetry, visual art, and other non-playwriting endeavors.\nThis is a reading-heavy and writing-centric course. Everything builds on what came before, so it's essential to stay on top of the work on a week-by-week basis.",
