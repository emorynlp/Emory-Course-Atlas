After fifteen years of decline, global recording revenues have begun to rebound with eight consecutive years of growth. Atlanta deserves some credit for this resurgence as it is widely known as the hip hop capital of the world. In this seminar students will meet with leaders and experts who will help them develop an understanding of how the music industry functions, how Atlanta has become an internationally recognized music city, and where the Atlanta music scene is headed. We will explore a range of topics, from artist development, artist compensation in the digital age, music technology, and the future of the music industry.\n\n\nInstructor:  Ben Yonas is a Grammy nominated music producer/engineer and artist manager.
