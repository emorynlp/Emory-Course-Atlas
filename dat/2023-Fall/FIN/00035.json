We will review the broad set of considerations that are addressed in M&A transactions. Emphasis will be placed on the technical aspects of M&A (valuation and transaction analysis). We will also briefly address certain qualitative transaction issues. Both strategic M&A transactions and Leveraged Buyout Outs (LBOs) will be reviewed. At the conclusion of the course, students should have an improved understanding of the M&A process, terminology, and mechanics. Specifically, students should understand key M&A transaction issues relating to: transaction consideration, takeover premium, financing arrangements, and value creation.",
