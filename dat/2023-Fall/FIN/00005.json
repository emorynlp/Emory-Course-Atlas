    "course_description": "The course objectives are to provide an understanding of drivers of value creation and destruction in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and to develop skills in the design and evaluation of these transactions. The focus of the course will be primarily to analyze M&A from the perspective of a financial advisor, integrating issues from economics, accounting, law, strategy and organizational behavior where appropriate. The theoretical justification for M&As is grounded in understanding the sources of firm value and how certain transactions enhance value. However, the reality may often be better understood by identifying the most powerful decision-makers and their private benefits.",
