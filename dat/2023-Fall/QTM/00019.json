    "class_notes": "Network analysis shifts the research focus from individual units to their connections and so brings both theoretical and methodological innovations. This course covers the major methods to collect, represent, and analyze network data. Selected topics include centrality analysis, positional analysis, clustering analysis, the exponential random graph model for modeling network formations, the stochastic actor-oriented model for dynamic network analysis, meta network analysis, weighted network analysis, text network analysis, causal analysis of network effects, and social network-based predictions and interventions. This course requires a basic knowledge of logistic regression and basic programming skills in R.\n\n\nCompletion of QTM 220 is highly recommended prior to enrolling in this course.",
