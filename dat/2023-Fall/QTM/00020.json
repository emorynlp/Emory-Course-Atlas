This demand has created immense professional opportunity for college graduates who have the right training. \nThis course aims to train students in a range of real-world case studies that apply the skillsets developed in QTM to these high-demand problems in digital analytics. The course has five sections that address digital problems in the pharmaceutical, consumer packaged goods, healthcare, technology, and finance industries. \nEach section contains 1) an interactive lecture component, which introduces the case study and provides a problem solving framework, and; 2) a group work component, in which students work in groups of 4-5 to tackle the case and present their solution. \nStudents will complete the course prepared for the type of work that applies their educational background to jobs at the world's leading companies and consulting firms.",
