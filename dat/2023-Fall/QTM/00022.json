A classic example is Arrow?s Impossibility Theorem, which tells us that, mathematically, every electoral sys- tem must fail to satisfy one or more criteria of fairness or sensibility. In addition to Arrow?s result we will examine other legislative paradoxes relating to how legislative seats are apportioned to states, how legislative agendas can be constructed to ensure the success or failure of a particular bill, and how systems of collective choice can (or can?t!) be constructed to reconcile individual liberty with the collective good. We will also discuss the mechanics and comparative properties of electoral systems in operation throughout the world: How these systems work, why they differ, and what this means for representative democracy. While there are no prerequisites for this class, you should have a willingness to learn about simple proofs, formal logic, and mathematical notation.",
