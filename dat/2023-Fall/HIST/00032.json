Where, when, and why do musical genres and styles emerge and spread? How does popular music express social history, cultural identities, ranges of feeling, \"authenticity,\" displacement and mobility, and political critique? Genres include: African American spirituals and gospel, the beginnings and early routes of jazz and blues, Appalachian secular and sacred styles, Louisiana Cajun and Zydeco, 'old time' and country music, the origins of rock and roll, soul, episodes of protest music, as well as the cultural contexts of klezmer, conjunto, salsa, rap, and recent 'singer-songwriter' styles.\nListening and reading assignments are linked from the course syllabus and/or will be made available on Emory e-reserves. Grading is based on attendance and participation, quizzes, a midterm and final exam. Not recommended for first year students.",
