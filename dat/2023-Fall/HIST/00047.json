Students in this course will explore how historians have written these fascinating historical narratives as well as practice examining primary sources and conducting archival research as we work toward our shared goal of writing microhistory ourselves. We will pay particular attention to the lives of ordinary people in different parts of the world between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries.",
