While primarily historical in approach, this course will draw on other disciplines, including cultural studies, anthropology, musicology, and sociology to arrive at a complex understanding of the experiences of Asians in the United States.\nThis course moves along both chronologically and thematically to investigate several timely issues facing the Asian American community today, including legal and illegal immigration, structural and cultural racism, and liberal and conservative politics. In addition to traditional historical sources, students will use photographs, film, music, art, and works of fiction as a lens through which to interpret multiple dimensions of Asian American lives.",
