    "class_notes": "Seeing hunger as a problem is a modern concept. Before the nineteenth century, most people saw hunger as a simple fact of life; something much of the population faced. This course examines the history of hunger as a conceptual category, tracking its changing meanings through the past two hundred years. It also examines the history of hunger as lived experience, both during acute episodes (famines) and chronic hunger. Finally, the course explores agricultural development and modernization from the fertilizer revolution of the 1830s, through the mid-twentieth century's Green Revolution, and up to the food price spikes of the 2000s. We will pay comparatively more attention to the history of the Americas, but the processes we study were and are global in scope and merit study at a large geographical scale.",
