This class will explore his principal achievement, an unfinished archaeology of the modern known as the Arcades Project, which consists of a series of fragments posthumously assembled by others. A palimpsest of theoretical reflection, historical narration, citations, excerpts, intertextual allusions, and metaphysical speculations, Benjamin's Passagen-werk is both highly resistant to the reader and extremely open to interpretation and appropriation. At once archive and unfinished magnum opus, this text embodies the material traces of a revolutionary method of cultural inquiry even as it attests to Benjamin's tragic failure to bring his dreams to reality.\n\n\nBy turning a work into a project, the English title begs the question of the relationship between that failure and Benjamin's distinctive achievement. Possibly, though, the Passagen-werk is not simply unfinished but unfinishable. In attempting to discern Benjamin's legacy in the fragmentary openness of this book that is not a book, we will ask what he can teach us as interdisciplinary scholars, as readers, and as critical participants in modern culture even as we develop a critical perspective on the reception history that represents his text as a coherent point of reference. In the spirit of carrying on Benjamin's legacy, students will be encouraged to pursue creative theoretical projects, including engaging with digital media.\nRequired texts: Benjamin: The Arcades Project\n \t         Eiland and Jennings: Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life",
