Materials will be selected from a broad range of materials across historical moments and national cultures. Selections will be made from among, but not limited to, the following: Sophocles' '\"Antigone\" and its staging by the Theater of War production; Charlotte Delbo, Convoy to Auschwitz: Women of the French Resistance; Vaclav Havel, Living in Truth; Jose Mu√±oz, Cruising Utopia; Assia Djebar, Fantasia: An Algerian Cavalcade; Lauren Berlant et al., \"The Feeltank Manifesto\": Dev Hochberg, Becoming Palestine: Toward an Archival Imagination of the Future; T.W. Adorno, \"On Foreign Words\"; Edward Said, Representations of the Intellectual; Svetlana Alexievich, Voices from Chernobyl; Eduardo Galeano, Memory of Fire; Mahasveta Devi, \"Draupadi.\" Participants in the seminar will be invited to contribute an additional work of their own choosing to our shared consideration.",
