They played a central part in the industrial revolutions of Britain, Europe, and the United States.  In the twentieth century they were adapted to much greener technology; Japanese and French electric trains have been running at 200 miles per hour since the 1960s, and a Chinese mag-lev train now runs at over 300.  This course will trace the development of railways around the world along with their social, political, and economic effects.  Requirements: class participation, two papers, a midterm, and a final.",
