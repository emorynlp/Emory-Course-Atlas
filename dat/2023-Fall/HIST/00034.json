South Africa's past and present raises profound historical and philosophical issues. How do we understand the creation of a racially divided, violent, and profoundly unequal society? How did various social groups emerge over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? How do we develop an empathic imagination around the issues of difference and diversity? These are some of the topics examined in the class as we explore the evolution of South Africa from a society based on the principle of systematic racial segregation to a multiracial democracy.",
