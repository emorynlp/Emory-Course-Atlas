Having reflected systematically on the issue of the authority of Scripture in DM721, participants in this course will have the opportunity to practice the art of theological interpretation of Old Testament texts. In relation to the broader goals of the Candler DMin program, this course focuses specifically on helping participants: explore the content and context of the Old Testament; identify how the content and context of the Old Testament might correspond with the needs/concerns of the contemporary parish context; and practice the interpretation of the Old Testament within the framework of a coherent theology of Scripture.",
