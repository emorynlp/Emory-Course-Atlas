Neither are new phenomena in U.S. history, however. Both anti-Jewish and anti-Islamic sentiments have origins that predate the United States' founding. This course examines that long history with a focus on the 20th century, during and after the mass immigrations of Jews, Arabs, and Muslims precipitated periods of heightened anxiety and discrimination. It will explore the way in which conceptions of race and religion shaped antisemitism, anti-Arabism, and Islamophobia in America, conceptions that were fostered and advanced by academics, politicians, and the media. Finally, the course will discuss the interplay between these prejudices and American policy, including foreign policy and domestic issues such as immigration, policing, and government surveillance.)",
