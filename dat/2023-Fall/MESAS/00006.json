Shy, beautiful, bejeweled, Hollywood scenes, food and dance? Or suppressed and victimized? Our seminar will look at India and its women and what makes them powerful. Our examples are:  the first female leader of India in the seventeenth century who killed ferocious tigers, to brilliant women journalist today who are risking their lives to tell important stories, to prize-winning environment activists, to ex-untouchable writer/activist. We will study primary sources, essays, films, fiction and art to think about India's women in different historical times and places. Our investigation will trace changeability - of peoples and of spaces - and with these of the rich and dynamic character of love, sexuality, filial relationships, and everyday life in the careers of India's women.)",
