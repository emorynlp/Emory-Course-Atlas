Indeed, Modern Hebrew literature devoted great attention to the subject, and the Holocaust is the main or secondary theme of numerous works, testimonial-fiction, stories and novels, poetry, and drama. The course is a survey of some of the main (translated into English) literary productions authored by survivors - Ida Fink, Abba Kovner, Dan Pagis, Yechiel Dinnur), and one author far distant from the scene of crime (Lea Goldberg.)",
