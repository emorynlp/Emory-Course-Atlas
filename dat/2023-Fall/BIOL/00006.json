The goal is also to inform students of how major lapses in ethical judgment have had detrimental long-lasting effects on our society. Students who take this course will learn how to analyze incidents of poor bio-ethical practice in research and medicine throughout our history. This course will connect these incidents with long term impacts on racial and ethnic minorities, those of differing sexual/gender identities, and other vulnerable populations. Students will use scholarly resources to independently study individual historical cases and analyze contemporary effects of health disparities and societal racial dynamics.",
