    "class_notes": "Jewish Experiences in the United States: 1880 to 2023.\nSince 1654, and even a bit before, Jews have had a presence on the land we now call the United States. They have adapted to the social norms of the surrounding culture and cultivated a sense of Jewish continuity, creating communities as diverse as the American colonies and the eventual republic. Jews have accomplished this feat despite periods of considerable social discrimination. In this course, we explore Jewish experiences in America after 1880, right before almost 2.5 million Jews migrated to the United States and dramatically transformed America's Jewish population. We focus special attention on Jewish experiences in Georgia and use this state to shine a light on key course topics, like immigration, assimilation, civil rights, and antisemitism. Our primary sources will include oral histories, comics, short stories, films, and YouTube videos.",
