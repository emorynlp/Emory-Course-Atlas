    "class_notes": "(Same as AMST 385 1)\n(Memory creates the foundation for who we understand ourselves to be. How do memoirs, acts of narrative, and self-construction use memory in the creation and revision of lived meaning? How do writers navigate the lines between truth and fact? What are some of the literary strategies that make for a compelling memoir? Addressing these and other questions, this course examines the choices memoirists make as they negotiate both memory and self-identifications such as gender, race, class, sexual orientation, geography, and religion. Readings will focus on a diverse variety of modern memoirs (books and essays), in addition to academic articles and studies on memory. In papers and journal entries, students will begin to learn the art of writing memoirs themselves.\nCourse assignments include regular one-page reading responses, weekly journal entries (not read by the professor), the leading of one discussion during the semester, a mid-term memoir paper (6-8 pages), and a final oral history paper (6-8 pages). No quizzes or tests. The course is discussion based, with complementary PowerPoint presentations by the professor. Consistent attendance is part of the grade.)",
