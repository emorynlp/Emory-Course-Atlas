Stories connect us, transform us, and allow us to express our deepest understanding of ourselves and the world we live in. In this seminar, we will explore the world of stories -- stories we tell about ourselves, stories we listen to told by the people around us, and stories we are surrounded by in our culture -- novels, movies and even tweets. Through scholarly reading and group research projects, we will learn what stories are and what they mean, how stories bring people together and tear them apart, and how we can all become more effective communicators by learning to tell our story.",
