    "class_notes": "We live in a culture that is saturated by visual images. Thus, it is vital to understand what forces shape visual culture and how it shapes our thinking about myriad topics such as politics, race, class, and gender. In this class we will explore the ways visual culture is produced, circulated, and consumed through a case study of visual representations of Islam and Muslims. We will cultivate the requisite historical and theoretical knowledge to unpack and analyze visual images of Islam and Muslims from a variety of contexts. Students will explore visual culture in multiple mediums including art, architecture, photography, comics, digital media, advertising, and television. We will begin by studying the major theories behind visual culture. Then, we will focus our critical inquiry on theories of orientalism and imperialism. We will consider how issues of authority, power, and positionality shape the creation and interpretation of visual images. Students will become adept at \"reading\" visual images in the same way they read other texts, and the discussion-based course will give students ample opportunity to hone this skill. As a class we will conduct a sustained analysis of visual images of Muslim women in comics, such as Ms. Marvel and Burka Avenger. We will also investigate the role major streaming platforms play in constructing an image of Islam and Muslims through popular culture.",
