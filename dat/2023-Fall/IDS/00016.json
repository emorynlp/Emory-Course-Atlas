Was there, as scholars frequently claim, a tangible cross-pollination between the emerging Russian self-consciousness in the nineteenth century and African American writing? How significant was it that, in contrast to the emphasis on rationality in the philosophical discourse of Western Europe, both the Russian intelligentsia and educated African American writers embraced the concept of soul? Did Russian writers share the themes of self-reliance, civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance so characteristic of American transcendentalists? Through a close examination of fictional short stories and philosophical essays of American, African American and Russian writers in the 19th century, this course will address the emerging emphasis on citizenship ? its calling, changing content, and ensuing responsibility.",
