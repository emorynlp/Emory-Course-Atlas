We will examine the fundamental changes in all main branches of Spanish linguistics and the role that language contact (both on the Peninsula and in the Americas), migration, and social status played in the formation of the present-day variation shown in the Spanish-speaking world today. We will also analyze concepts related to language change as they relate to observable phenomena in the history of Spanish.",
