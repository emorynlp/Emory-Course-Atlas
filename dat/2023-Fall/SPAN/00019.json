Rather than a mechanical operation, the process of translation is a reworking and re-creation that requires intercultural as well as interlingual expertise on the part of the practitioner. To this end, students will engage in activities including: identifying and translating genre and register; intralingual translation; comparing source texts (STs) to multiple translated texts (TTs); using parallel texts as tools for intercultural understanding; translations from source language (SL) into English; inverse translation; group translations and workshops; and editing, revising, reflection, analysis and commentary on their own translations.",
