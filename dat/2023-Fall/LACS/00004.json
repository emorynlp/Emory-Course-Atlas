Across the globe, within countries, the wealth and income gap between the top 10% and the bottom 50% has doubled. This means that overall global inequalities among the world's population are as great now as they were at the beginning of the twentieth century, the peak of European imperialism. This economic reality, coupled with a sense of climate crisis and limited material resources for further growth, has raised significant questions about the usefulness of past models of economic development and poverty alleviation. This course adopts a historical approach to development policies and their critics in order to better understand our current dilemmas. Students will engage in conversations and possible mentoring relations with Alumni who are legal professionals in the field of development. We will also learn about related internships.",
