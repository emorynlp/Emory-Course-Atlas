This course looks at the history of our city through a linguistic lens: language, language use, language variation and change, and how they reflect race dynamics here. We'll begin by learning about indigenous languages that were once spoken in this region (Mvskoke and Cherokee); discuss African American language (AAL) and white southern U.S. English in Atlanta over time; conduct first-hand research on contemporary variation and change within both of these varieties; and learn about Spanish and other languages spoken by more recent immigrant populations.\n\n\nReadings will be available on Course Reserves or Canvas.",
