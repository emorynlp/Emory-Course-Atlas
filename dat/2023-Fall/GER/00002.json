In this cultural context, critics and scholars frequently debate whether \"games can be literature,\" or should rather be treated as a distinct artistic medium. In this seminar, we will approach these questions by studying games and gaming through the lens of the German intellectual tradition. Since the 18th century, major German philosophers and literary writers have considered 'play' (the German word Spiel means both 'play' and 'game') to be an important component of human creativity and a fundamental expression of human freedom. As such, modern German literature and philosophy have produced a broad range of works that can help us think through the significance of games and their artistic, cultural, and social significance today. This seminar will be divided into three units.",
