We will study the play in Spanish, and prepare for a dramatic reading of the text, practicing oral skills, theater techniques, play analysis, and the bringing-to-life of a dramatic story. The course culminates in a public staged reading of the play (scripts in hand), including selections of Lorca's poetry and featuring Flamenco music and dance. We will also attend the Theater Emory production of Blood Wedding and place both texts and both languages in conversation with one another.\nPrerequisite: Spanish 212",
