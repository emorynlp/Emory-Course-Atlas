Biblically, the course will introduce students to the growing field of Asian American interpretation. Historically, the class will examine how prominent events in Asian American history, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Delano Grape Strike, and the passage of the Hart-Cellar Act, may dialogue with biblical texts. Socially, the class will examine confluences and tensions when Asian American interpretations interact with modern faith communities.",
