Additionally, you will learn about the mechanics of publication, the various forums and opportunities for publication, and even hear about the kinds of jobs available in the publishing industry, such as editing. You will do a mini-internship, seeing your work into print with The Wheel or another local venue. You will also polish something already written for submission to an academic journal or contest, revising the piece based on detailed feedback from instructor and peer.
