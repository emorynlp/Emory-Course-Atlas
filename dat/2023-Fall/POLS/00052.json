The course is organized thematically with two goals in mind: first, to enable students to understand the intellectual trajectory of the study of these topics and second, to expose them to research frontiers in these areas. The expectation is that students will complete the course not only with a better understanding of the comparative subfield as a whole, but also with their own ideas for further research.",
