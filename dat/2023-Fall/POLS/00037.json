Students should contact Michelle Gordon, Ph.D. at michelle.yvonne.gordon@emory.edu for application information.\n\n\nThis class is the first part of a two-course sequence associated with the Imagining Democracy Lab, a grant-funded initiative to link imagination, knowledge, and action to advance civic and political engagement. In this class we will engage with academic perspectives from the humanities and social sciences on the concept of democracy, then examine how these perspectives have (or have not) manifested in the experience of communities in the Atlanta area specifically and American democracy more broadly. To this end, we will learn from leaders of nationally-renown civic and political engagement organizations in Georgia in addition to faculty from Emory and other institutions. We will explore course material through a mix of lectures, discussion sessions, group presentations, and an individual final research paper that entails deep study of themes from the course. The course is open to students with any major, but students must complete a short application before receiving permission to enroll. Students should contact Michelle Gordon, Ph.D. at michelle.yvonne.gordon@emory.edu for application information.",
