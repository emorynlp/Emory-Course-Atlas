    "class_notes": "This course will interrogate the causes and consequences of violence used in the pursuit of political goals. We will begin by nesting political violence in the context of state power and the dynamics of oppression. We will then consider the tactical choices that lead individuals and groups to take up violence in pursuit of their political goals, evaluate how and under what conditions different sorts of political violence are likely to occur, interrogate the motivations of individual members of militant movements, and consider how political violence ends. We will finish with a deep look at the profound impacts of this sort of violence, including environmental and economic impacts, but also considering famine and health outcomes, and the likelihood of conflict reoccurrence.",
