We will cover three primary topics: 1) protection of civilians in conflict and humanitarian intervention; 2) interactions between combatants and civilians; 3) responses of civilians to conflict. The course begins by examining laws and norms that dictate how combatants treat civilians. We will then consider the consequences of conflict for civilians, covering topics like indiscriminate violence, rebel governance, conscription, and child soldiers. The course also assesses how civilians exercise agency in conflict by studying protest, non-violent resistance, and migration and refugees.",
