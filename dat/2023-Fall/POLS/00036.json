Dictators face constant threats of violent overthrow and have two primary tools at their disposal for confronting these threats: coercion (sticks) and power sharing (carrots). We first examine topics related to coercion: the guardianship dilemma, revolutionary authoritarian parties, controlling the Internet, coercive development, and dictatorships at war. We then examine power-sharing institutions such as positions in the central government and succession rules, including competitive authoritarian elections. We finish the course by discussing regime transitions from and to dictatorship. Throughout, we consider contemporary and historical examples from across world regions.",
