From communist protest in Iraq to the Arab Spring protests across the region in 2011 to the use of modern music and art to effect political change, this course will demonstrate the ways in which people in different times and in protest of different types of political institutions have organized to effect political change. In so doing, we will analyze the most effective means of political protest and organization (eg, the use of mass gatherings, electoral campaigns and boycotts, social media) in the authoritarian and semi-authoritarian regimes of the Middle East.)",
