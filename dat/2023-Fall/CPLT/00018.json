You will participate in a number of activities central to post-secondary instruction in composition, including assignment and syllabus development, scoring guide/rubric development, and lesson planning. You will respond to sample student papers and conduct lessons and activities that integrate the texts you have selected. You will also examine and reflect on the classroom practices and course materials of an experienced first-year writing teacher as you prepare to teach segment of that person's class. These activities are informed by praxis-oriented readings selected to broaden your knowledge of writing instruction in the first-year course and across the curriculum.",
