Each individual and society exists within an environment, and the character of this relation not only influences the relations of human and non-human creatures, but also lies at the heart of human self-understanding. Through reflection upon these and related issues, this course will develop critical reading, writing, and thinking skills by way of an introduction to and encounter with contemporary issues in environmental philosophy.",
