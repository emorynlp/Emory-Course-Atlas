As its name suggests, postcolonial theory is indebted both to anticolonial thought and to poststructuralist theory. Although some knowledge of either anticolonial thought or poststructuralist theory would be welcome, it is not required for this course.\n\n\nIn this course, we will read selected texts by the postcolonial scholars Edward W. Said, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Homi K. Bhabha, Ranajit Guha, Partha Chatterjee, V.Y. Mudimbe, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Trinh T. Minh-ha, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, Stuart Hall, Arjun Appadurai, Paul Gilroy, Kobena Mercer, Cornel West, bell hooks, Gloria Anzald√∫a, Coco Fusco, Lisa Lowe, Rey Chow, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Pheng Cheah, and Achille Mbembe. Although our class discussions will be based on our assigned reading, we may also draw from literature, art, film, and music from outside our course in addressing the issues of colonialism, race, gender, language, culture, and representation.\n\n\nFour (4) response papers #1 (2-3 pp. each, 40% total)\nLong essay (8-10 pp., 40%)\nAttendance and participation (20%)\n\n\nAll required readings will be made available in electronic format on Course Reserves.",
