Topics range from aggression and dominance to affiliation, sex and peaceful coexistence. The evolution of the large brain and remarkable intelligence of primates has been explained as related to the complexity of their societies: survival in such societies requires sophisticated social skills and a thorough understanding of the relationship network. Course segments focus on the motivational and cognitive processes \nunderlying coalition formation, reciprocal exchange of benefits, reconciliation following conflict, and the origin of moral systems. Parallels with human behavior will be discussed.\nThis course requires PSYC 110 or BIOL 142 or BIOL_OX142 or equivalent transfer credit as a prerequisite.",
