Throughout the dizzy history of rapid industrialization and modernization, the Korean government has taken advantage of national cinema in a way to create an array of positive national images and identities. While nationalist narratives have pervaded Korean cinema, a number of filmmakers were able to develop internationalist film styles which, rather than remaining ancillary to narrative, has created compelling aesthetics that belies and debunks nationalism.",
