    "course_description": "Whiteness, attended by a belief in its purity, superiority and rightness, is killing white people. Wrestling with this idea is part of the fundamental framework of this class, as we prepare leaders and ministers for life-saving/soul-saving work in the 21st century. Understanding that race and religion are co-constitutive this class examines the ways in which religion has been central to the construction, maintenance and fierce guardianship of racialized categories in the US. In this course we explore the many variations of that embodiment and wrestle with its historical and contemporary consequences. We ask how race has become so integral to religious identity, especially in the US? And, we explore how religion has informed our racial narratives. Through historical, anthropological and sociological works we examine their social import particularly to American Christianity.",
