    "course_description": "As cities have often been loci of spiritual innovation, this course examines unique characteristics of spiritual communities embedded in urban contexts. Class will examine ¿urban religion¿ from two sides: 1) the manner in which spiritual communities contribute to the shape & life of the city 2) the ways that urban realities influence spiritual communities. As such, ¿urban religion will be framed as more than just religion which happens to be in the city, but rather as religion which is complexly intertwined with the realities of the modern cityscape. Particular attention will be given to spiritual communities & practices that serve marginalized communities in the city. Course material will primarily draw from the social sciences and will examine not only formal religious institutions, but also informal spiritual communities. To that effect, we will employ a ¿lived religion¿ approach which privileges the voice of the everyday person above that of institutional authorities.",
