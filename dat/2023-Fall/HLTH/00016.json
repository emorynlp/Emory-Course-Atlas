This requires first familiarizing ourselves with the major classical approaches to this field (Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Natural Law, etc.) and then evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each of these approaches for a variety of health care situations. Some of the topics covered include patient rights, research ethics, reproductive rights, abortion eugenics, euthanasia, organ transplantation, and inequalities in our health care system.",
