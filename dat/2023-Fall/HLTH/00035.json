As situated within the context of biomedicine, we closely consider ways in which stigma produces illness (manifested as uneven patterns of disease at the population level), as well as ways in which illness produces stigma (whereby people experiencing illness become the targets of exclusion). Specific areas of focus include non-normative body appearance, impaired mobility, chronic disease, mental health, and reproductive health. Toward the end of the course, we examine the effectiveness of various anti-stigma interventions at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and institutional/structural levels.",
