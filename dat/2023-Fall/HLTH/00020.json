In the recent convergence of conventional medical therapies and complementary and alternative practices, this course reviews various modalities used in therapeutic care models focused on the whole person: body, mind and spirit, and for which there is scientific basis for safety and efficacy. In evidence-informed study, the course examines a range of integrative modalities applied to the physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual and environmental determinants of health and healing. Important elements related to philosophy, practice, and policy are addressed as underpinnings to this integrative health paradigm)(Prerequisite: HLTH 210)",
