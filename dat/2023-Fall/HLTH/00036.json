Consequently, the most powerful and sustainable solutions require collaborative insights and collective action from a wide range of individuals and groups (stakeholders). In this course, you will develop concrete skills to work with diverse stakeholders in order to promote human health for a defined global health problem. We will apply collaboration skills to 1) recruit diverse groups with interest in the problem, 2) purposefully synthesize their insights and 3) collaboratively generate practical solutions for the problem and 4) mobilize broad support for the solution. Prerequisite: HLTH 250",
