We will explore the roles and integrated functons of the nervous, musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory, and other body systems in regulating and supporting human movement. This will include how the body behaves at rest as well as responds and adapts to challenges such as routine exercise or disuse. The significance of movement and exercise training in human health will be discussed.",
