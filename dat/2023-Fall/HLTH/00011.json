Sometimes considered \"the forgotten organ\" , this collection of bacteria, viruses, and single-cell eukaryotes is crucial for our health. We will examine the vital functions provided by the microbiome, as well as the conditions under which the microbiome is associated with disease. Areas of focus will include obesity, insulin resistance, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, antibiotic resistance, and more. (Prerequisite: BIOL 142)",
