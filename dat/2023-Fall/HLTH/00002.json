Students who enroll in this course should possess a strong curiosity in understanding physical activity/inactivity within a transdisciplinary, historical framework and beyond the established, traditional physical benefits of exercise or sport. Topics of investigation will be presented through a transdisciplinary perspective utilizing lectures and group discussions, individual and group projects, and community engagement.)",
