    "class_notes": "\"IÂ love America more than any other country in this world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.\"  James Baldwin, \"Autobiographical Notes\"            How can the equally indicting and aspirational words of James Baldwin be instructive for our present crises? How can Baldwin's work and guidance shape our own ethical commitments? In this course, we will explore the idea of America through looking back at the writing of James Baldwin. While we will primarily read Baldwin's essays, we will also explore Baldwin's ideas as depicted in poetry, fiction, and drama as well as approach an understanding of Baldwin as a public intellectual and activist through published interviews, speeches, debates, and his frequent appearances on television. Finally, we will explore Baldwin's legacy through the thinkers, writers, and cultural critics who have written about him and the movements that have cited his words and ideas as inspiration. This course fulfills continuing communication, pathways of inquiry, and race and ethnicity requirements.",
