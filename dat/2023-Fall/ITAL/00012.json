Porcarelli\nContent:  Literature has long explored the journey metaphor as a central theme, whether it be physical or symbolic. This class will examine the ways in which travel narratives contemplate notions of chance and choice, discovery and transformation, and search and struggle. By situating Italy as an intermediate space, marked by internal and external transitions throughout its geography and history, we will investigate how the journey motif can serve as a valuable tool for shaping, negotiating, and challenging identity. Throughout the semester, we will analyze a variety of texts arranged chronologically, beginning with Ulysses' travels in Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy and culminating in contemporary postcolonial and migration travel narratives.",
