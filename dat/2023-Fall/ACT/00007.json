You will identify relevant research, access appropriate databases, and use effective tools for performing analyses to distinguish between the fundamental value versus investor sentiment components of stock prices. Using these accounting signals will therefore aid in selecting stocks that potentially earn abnormal stock returns and beat the market.",
