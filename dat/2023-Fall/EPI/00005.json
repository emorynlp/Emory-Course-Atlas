    "course_description": "Transforming Public Health Surveillance (TPHS) provides a review of the history, purposes, activities, uses, elements, data sources, models, analyses, actions, reports, evaluation, and ethical and legal issues of public health surveillance (PHS). It helps students understand the critical importance of the direct association between PHS and public health action, plus develop skills and competencies with the use of data-information-messages and the information and communication technologies that enable, enhance, and empower them. TPHS describes informatics approaches to enable and enhance data sharing, analytics, and visualization though interoperability that adapts to meet the challenges as PHS moves from analog to digital and demonstrates how PHS core functions (i.e., detection, registration, confirmation, analysis, feedback, communication, and response) will be enabled, enhanced, and empowered by these opportunities.
