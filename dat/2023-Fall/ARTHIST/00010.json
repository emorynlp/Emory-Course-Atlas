    "class_notes": "\"Art in Paris, 1900-1914\"This course will focus on avant-garde art in Paris in the years preceding the First World War. Its aim will be to understand the complex dynamics of what we call the avant-garde. This will involve an intensive treatment of certain key problems--important works, moments of decisive change, dominant individuals. At the center of the course will be the achievement of CÃ©zanne and the struggle to lay claim to his art, Matisse's place in the avant-garde world, the Cubism of Picasso and Braque, and a range of practices around the invention of cubist collage.\nArt History major/minor: Division III",
