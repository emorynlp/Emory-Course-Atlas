Complementary themes such as the arts of nature and royalty, divination and masquerade, architecture and the body, and initiation and funerary rites will serve as guiding frameworks. Examining various artistic mediums (e.g. metal, wood, clay, beads, textiles, and the body), students will investigate how the arts have been used to build African empires, invent polyrhythmic music, resist colonialism and slavery, and open portals to the divine world. Ultimately, this class will encourage students to redefine their definitions of art and cultivate greater appreciation for Africa's vibrant aesthetic traditions and dynamic material cultures.",
