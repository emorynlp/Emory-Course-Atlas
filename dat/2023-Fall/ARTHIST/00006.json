The Parthenon, the Venus de Milo, and other works and imitations define modern cityscapes and museums, and the Greek model has been challenged, revived, and reinterpreted over the centuries.\nThis course aims to consider the material culture of the peoples we understand as the ancient Greeks on their own terms, through an in-depth survey of the arts, architecture, and archaeology of Greek communities from the end of the Bronze Age to the Roman conquests (1050-150 BCE). Students will not only learn about cultural centers like Athens and canonical works of art and architecture, but also about the arts of the wider ancient Greek diaspora attested from the Iberian Peninsula to modern day Afghanistan.   \nThe course will consist of lectures supplemented by structured discussions of scholarship. Student performance will be assessed through the completion of slide examinations (midterm and final), as well as a short visual analysis paper resulting from several instructor-led trips to the Carlos Museum.\nArt History major/minor: Division I\nArchitectural Studies minor: elective)",
