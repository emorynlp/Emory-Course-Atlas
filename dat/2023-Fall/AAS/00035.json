Historians have explored enslavement, Black women's resistance and activism and have charted labor movements and mapped the lives of everyday African American women. Yet key areas remain in need of richer exploration:Black queer histories, expanded studies of the Black experience of the carceral state, and examinations of violence and vice. Our course will study works that interrogate these themes to better understand how scholars undertake this research. At the same time, we will consider how these issues play out in the lives of everyday Black women, paying particular attention to the ways that Black women's efforts at erotic and bodily sovereignty often collide with the regulatory forces of the state.",
