A significant portion of the course will be devoted to Black feminisms of the late 20th century, examining the works of canonical thinkers, including Audre Lorde, bell hooks, and Patricia Hill Collins. We will also explore contemporary scholarship, with particular attention to the work of queer and trans Black feminists. The course materials will include books, articles, films, podcasts, music videos, and social media. Some core questions guiding this course include: What is Black feminism and its many iterations? Why are Black feminisms necessary? How are Black feminists changing American politics?",
