Interest in network analysis has EXPLODED in the past few years, due to new advancements in statistical modeling and the rapid availability of network data. This course covers the major methods to collect, represent, and analyze network data. Selected topics include centrality analysis, positional analysis, clustering analysis, the exponential random graph model for modeling network formations, the stochastic actor-oriented model for dynamic network analysis, meta network analysis, weighted network analysis, text network analysis, causal analysis of network effects, and social network-based predictions and interventions. Examples are drawn from a wide range of disciplines. Students will learn hands-on skills to conduct their own research by using R packages. This course requires a basic knowledge of logistic regression and basic programming skills in R.",
