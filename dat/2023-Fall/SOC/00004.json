    "class_notes": "What is social inequality? How can we observe, or measure, it appropriately? To what extent does culture shape inequality? Is social inequality inevitable? This course explores how class, status, and power arrangements in our society produce, and reproduce, unequal access to valuable resources (e.g., education, income, wealth, affordable housing, etc.), making for unequal social realities among people. We seek to determine how structural forces impact not only our individual lives, but the families, social groups, and larger communities to which we belong. In addition to examining structural mechanisms, we will also unpack the cultural notions that have facilitated systems of inequality for decades. Last, we will consider possible strategies that could serve to curb trends of social inequality.",
