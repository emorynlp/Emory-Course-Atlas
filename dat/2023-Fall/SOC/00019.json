    "class_notes": "Progressivism and its Discontents. Course Description: Progressivism is one of the most influential ideologies of our time. Progressive views prevail in higher education and progressive assumptions shape a wide range of public policies. But how valid are progressive arguments? Even where they appear to command broad support, what might be a serious case against them? To address such questions, this course critically examines currently influential progressive approaches to controversial issues and public policy through sustained argumentation and debate. Besides a very brief history of progressivism, topics are likely to include inequality, meritocracy, education, the Constitution, nationalism, and climate change, among others. The course aims to show by example, and with active student involvement, how best to make a case in support of, or in opposition to, various positions. Intended to illustrate the possibility and value of viewpoint diversity, the course is suitable for students of all persuasions with a taste for vigorous debate and open to challenging conventional wisdom.",
