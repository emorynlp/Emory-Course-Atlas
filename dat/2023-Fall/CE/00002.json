    "course_description": "For Contextual Education 1, first-year MDiv students choose a social service or clinical setting unless they enroll in the Teaching Parish or Episcopal Studies track. Four hours of weekly engagement at these sites during the entire academic year give students the opportunity to experience various ministries, contexts, and pastoral relationships. In the first semester, students meet weekly in their 90-minute Contextual Education I site Reflection Group led by their site supervisor. In the second semester, students continue working four hours per week at the same Contextual Education I site. Students meet with a faculty member (usually their academic adviser) and their site supervisor for a weekly, two-hour Integrative Seminar. An evaluation is made at the end of each semester and an in progress (IP) grade is assigned at the end of the first semester if the student is performing satisfactorily. To receive credit, the student must satisfactorily complete two consecutive semesters.",
