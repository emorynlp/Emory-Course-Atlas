    "course_description": "Basic Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) is available to seminarians during the fall, spring, and summer of each year at sites accredited by the national Association for Clinical Pastoral Education (ACPE). CPE is most often located in hospitals, clinics, and community agencies, and the program has a concentrated focus on pastoral care, counseling, and relational skills development. Some traditions (e.g., UM Conferences) require CPE for ordination; students need to determine those specific requirements. CPE can be a part of a person's preparation for parish, chaplaincy, lay ministry, teaching and counseling. Students apply directly to the site where they would like to do CPE. Once accepted into a particular CPE program, students can apply for Candler academic credit for CPE through the Office of Contextual Education.",
