    "course_description": "This course explores contemporary issues in tax policy. Topics include: (1) Taxpayer privacy (e.g., should the tax returns of ultra-wealthy taxpayers and politicians like former President Trump be public records?); (2) Choice of tax base (e.g., should we tax income, consumption, wealth, or wage?); (3) Constitutional constraints on the choice of the federal tax base (e.g., are unapportioned wealth taxes like those proposed by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders constitutional?); (4) Taxation and inequality (e.g., what are the policy options for taxing the rich?); (5) Taxation of the territories (e.g., should Puerto Rico have a progressive tax structure like the federal income tax?); (6) Taxation of sexuality, reproductive rights, and parenthood (e.g., should surrogacy costs for LGBTQ parents be tax-deductible?). Federal income tax is not a prerequisite.",
