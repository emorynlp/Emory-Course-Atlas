Using a simulated case file in a gender discrimination case, the class will serve to develop the skills, strategies, and tactics necessary to be an effective courtroom advocate. The course will also develop your knowledge of gender discrimination and employment substantive law and will explore specific trial issues that may be particularly important when trying a gender discrimination case.
