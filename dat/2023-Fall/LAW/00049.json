    "course_description": "Deal Skills builds on the skills and concepts learned in Contract Drafting and emphasizes the skills and thought processes involved in, and required by, the practice of transactional law. The course introduces students to business and legal issues common to commercial transactions, such as M&A deals, license agreements, commercial real estate transactions, financing transactions, and other typical transactions. Students learn to interview, counsel, and communicate with simulated clients; conduct various types of due diligence; translate a business deal into contract provisions; understand basic transaction structure, finance, and risk reduction techniques; and negotiate and collaboratively draft an agreement for a simulated transaction. Classes involve both individual and group work, with in class exercises, role-plays and oral reports supported by lecture and weekly homework assignments. Note: Open enrollment will be available to non-transactional certificate students on a space-available basis to students with required pre-reqs once open enrollment starts.",
