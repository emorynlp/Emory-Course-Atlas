    "course_description": "Copyright law addresses fundamental theoretical questions about the nature of authorship, creativity, originality, and similarity. It also addresses central economic questions about the allocation of rights and responsibilities between those who produce creative works and those who engineer the technologies that interact with those works. This course addresses foundational issues in copyright law, including eligible copyright subject matter, formalities and duration, authorship and ownership, reproductions and derivative works, copyright infringement, fair use, and remedies for infringement. Some of the more advanced issues addressed include copyrightable characters; copyright protection of compilations, databases and computer software; copyright in architectural works; photography; sound recordings; the scope of direct liability on the internet, and for cloud computing; digital technology and fixation; and the non-expressive use of copyrighted works by copy-reliant technologies, including machine learning and AI applications.",
