Jurisdiction over its own territory to that extent is an incident of every independent nation.\" This seminar asks: Is the justification of immigration law so self-evident? We will examine statutes, cases, and treaties alongside work in ethics, jurisprudence, and political theory from Gloria Anzald√∫a, Seyla Benhabib, Joseph Carens, Emer de Vattel, Michael Walzer, and others to interrogate defenses and critiques of immigration law and explore whether other kinds of legal imaginaries should be possible.",
