    "course_description": "Digital Asset Regulation provides an overview of the U.S. regulatory environment for the application of blockchain technology to digital value transfer (e.g., bitcoin, Ethereum, NFTs, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies). We will examine regulation of digital assets from both a practitioner's and user's perspective. Digital asset regulation is nascent. For the practitioner, we will examine the fundamentals of how digital assets are currently regulated and the issues in need of regulatory clarity (e.g., custody, legal classification).",
