These purpose-driven organizations, which make up the $6 trillion social solution economy, encompass an array of business models that range from traditional nonprofits to for-profit companies and hybrid organizations focusing on social outcomes.  We will also cover the importance of key actors in the sector, including foundations / grant makers, charities, service providers, B corps, impact and ESG investors, government entities, and social enterprises.",
