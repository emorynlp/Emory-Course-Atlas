Using different strategy tools, we will analyze industries, and companies to see how they can compete differently for competitive advantage. Healthcare costs in the US are 15%+ of GDP and some estimate that more than 1/3 of that is waste.  The class will address this important, complex, and challenge problem together.",
    "course_description": "A Directed Study (DS) is conducted with permission and semi-autonomously, under the supervision of a Goizueta faculty member. The content should represent a line of intellectual inquiry that is aligned with, but falls outside, what is available in the context of the School's elective offerings. It replaces an academic course and may carry variable academic hours. The DS project should contain significant & commensurate content that carries the rigor, time commitment & standards of an elective in the area of study.",
