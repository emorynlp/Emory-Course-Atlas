Yet, for decades, the study of Nazi genocide ignored their unique vulnerability. This course will examine children's experiences in Nazi Europe, as well as the Holocaust representations in book for young readers. How does children's literature deal with the Holocaust, we will ask. How should it do it? Analyzing books written in variety of languages - including Yiddish, Hebrew, German, Polish, and English - we will explore varied means of conveying the horrors of the Holocaust and its diverse didactic messages. To survey children's experiences under Hitler rule, we will study diaries, letters, and drawings authored by Jewish children in ghettos, camps, and in hiding, and Nazi youth-aimed propaganda.",
