The readings will move through several periods and geographical locations: from early Christianity to the 20th century, passing through medieval Iraq, and early modern Spain. We will primarily focus on the Abrahamic traditions and address their reception in 20th-century-European thought. Questions of gender and erotism will be particularly highlighted. This course works across media and genres including painting, film, and writing, as well as philosophy, poetry, and theology. Some authors we will study are Ibn al Arabi, Teresa de Ávila, Gershom Scholem, and Salvador Dalí. Through the course, we will learn to apply comparative methods from literary analysis to cultural critique in written assignments and class discussions.",
