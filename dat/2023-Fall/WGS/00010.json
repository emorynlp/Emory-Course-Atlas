    "class_notes": "Feminist Theory delves deeply into the foundational and vibrantly contested debates that define the field of feminist theory. Students will become familiar with a variety of theoretical perspectives, including those influenced by queer theory, trans studies, Black feminism, Marxism, radical feminism, post-structuralist feminism, psychoanalysis, and more. In doing so, students will develop an understanding of the disjunctures and disagreements that have propelled feminist theory forward, making it both a dynamic field of scholarly research and an indispensable analytic that guides feminist politics. The course also explores the ways in which feminist theory politicizes philosophical questions such as \"what is a subject\"?. In addition to gaining a deeper understanding of feminist theory, students will also hone their analytic skillset by evaluating, interpreting, and elaborating on said theories, as well as applying those theories to current feminist debates, in the form of written assignments and engaged class discussion.",
    "course_description": "This course will explore feminist theory by tracing how feminist ideas have circulated through different methods, approaches, and perspectives. It may include a range of global and transnational perspectives.",
