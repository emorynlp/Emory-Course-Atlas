What difference does the election of more women, people of color, and LGBTQ individuals really make? Would it mean that women and minorities (racial, ethnic, and/or sexual) are better represented? What does it mean to represent women, racial/ethnic minorities, or sexual minorities? This course will address these questions from the perspective of legislative politics in the United States, at both the national and state levels. We will begin with a brief examination of the meaning and value of political representation. Then we will explore the empirical research on the politics of race, gender, sexuality, and representation as it relates to: candidate emergence, elections, legislative behavior, and the policymaking process. Throughout the course, in readings, discussions, and assignments, students will compare \"single-axis\" approaches to studying the politics of race, gender, and sexuality to more intersectional approaches.",
