    "course_description": "This course will explore the writings of the French philosopher Michel Foucault. We will focus in particular on Foucault's historical analysis of madness, the rise of sexuality, the power of normalization, the disciplinary production of delinquency and deviance, and the biopolitical specification of bodies and populations in the modern era. We will also pay special attention to Foucault's discursive style and genealogical method. Our main objective will be to read Foucault's work in depth rather than to examine how his work has been used by others.",
