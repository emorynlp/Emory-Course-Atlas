The topics discussed and tasks assigned will be fitted to the interests and needs of participating students, and will be finalized in the first few weeks of the semester. Nonetheless, topics or tasks most likely will include: refining research questions; identifying scholarly contributions; clarifying concepts and conceptual or theoretical frameworks; and thinking self-consciously and critically about methods of inquiry. For the purposes of this course, methods is defined broadly to include questions, concerns, and debates about doing research, or making informed choices about available tools of inquiry and analysis. The intention is to include, support, and evaluate the full range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches that students bring to the table, from the most humanistic to the most scientific (and everything else between and beyond that dichotomy). Students will be expected to work both individually and collaboratively on their projects and, thus, should be willing and able to both give and receive constructive criticism. The instructor and students will also work collaboratively with dissertation advisors, to the extent possible.)",
