It is geared toward graduate students and advanced undergraduates who intend to pursue (or have already conducted) research on topics ranging from human rights, humanitarianism, gender inequities, and sex trafficking to mass incarceration, racialized state violence, and social justice. Throughout the course we will examine regimes of knowledge, power, and governance, and why, as many scholars claim, the rise of neoliberal globalization has typically gone hand in hand with a punitive turn both in legal arenas and in more expansive cultural-political domains. One of the more general goals of the course is to explore how contemporary discourses and practices bearing on crime, risk, security, and policing illuminate new forms of sovereignty and citizenship as well as recent transformations in the relationships linking capital, governance, and the state.",
