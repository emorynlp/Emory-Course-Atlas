Why do certain political subjects have an easier time being protected than others? In this course, we will explore theories of power in relation to questions of violence and vulnerability to understand how vulnerable groups are created and cemented in relation to elite and powerful populations. How does violence manifest itself institutionally? How does vulnerability become imposed through various logics and techniques: of law, of class, of race? Power, violence, vulnerability can be inflicted and challenged through technologies, understood conceptually as instruments by which to accomplish certain ends. Readings will include writings in the traditions of decolonial, Latinx, and Black feminist theories, Foucauldian and Indigenous writings on power, land and sovereignty. Authors may include Frantz Fanon, Françoise Vergès, Joy James, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Maria Lugones, Michel Foucault, Christina Sharpe, Katherine McKittrick, and Elaine Scarry among others.)",
