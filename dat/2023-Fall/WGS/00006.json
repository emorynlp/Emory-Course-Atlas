In this course, we'll explore the experience of Jewish women as they accommodated to the socioeconomic and ideological challenges of modernity in Europe and the United States, and how ideas about gender played a role in the construction of Jewish identities in the modern period.  Using a gendered lens, we'll ask how gender and sexuality \nfundamentally shaped modern Jewish historical experience, identity, ideology, and imagination from the 17th  century forward.  To do so, we will not simply \"add women and stir,\" to borrow a phrase from feminist historians; rather, we will query how gender - the culturally and hierarchically constructed differences between the sexes based on perceived differences - has influenced women's lives and actions.)",
