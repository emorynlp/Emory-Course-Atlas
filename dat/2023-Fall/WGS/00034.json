    "class_notes": "(Same as FREN 785 2)\nContent: The late 20th and 21st centuries have often been called the age of migration with the mass movement of peoples redefining the relationship between migrants and the states that house them. Some scholars even maintain that international migration is the human face of globalization, but human mobility across national borders has a long history that has taken various and sundry forms. From forced migrations to impelled and chain migrations, politically driven and economically motivated migration, individual and collective mobility defies notions of territoriality and citizenship, nationality and belonging. This course will examine literature and cinema from the French-speaking world that take up questions of migration from a multi-modal perspective, mobilizing a particular set of aesthetics, developing a migrant poetics and interrogating the ethics of em/immigration. Our study will revolve around multiple states of migration, exploring how the political landscape and economic backdrop spur mobility and shape cultural production, questioning the very limits of the nationhood, statehood through the lens of migration.\n\n\nWorks studied may include:\nWajdi Mouawad, Incendies (2003); Denis Villeneuve, Incendies (2010); Régine Robin, La Québécoite (1993) ; Aimé Césaire, Cahier d'un retour au pays natal( 1939) and Abderrahmane Sissako, La vie sur terre (1998), En attendant le bonheur (2003)\nYing Chen, Lettres chinoises (1993); Philippe Falardeau, Pâté chinois (1997); Shan Sa, Le Miroir du Calligraphe (2002)\nRaoul Peck, Lumumba : Mort du prophète (1990);  Emile Ollivier, Passages (2002)\nOusmane Sembène, La Noire de' (1966); Fatou Diome, La Préférence Nationale (2001)\n \nThis seminar will be taught in English.",
