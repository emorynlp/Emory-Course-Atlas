The course explores different organ system based physiologic principles, including those related to cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, muscular, digestive, neural, endocrine systems. Other topics include metabolism, tissue regeneration, pain and inflammation. By completing the course, students are expected to gain knowledge of the mechanisms and principles underlying physiological systems and its application to pathophysiology. Case based discussions will be integrated into the course.",
