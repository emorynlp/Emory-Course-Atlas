Whether because of state censorship or generalized shame, historical archives and methods fail to account for the past and perpetuate colonial violence. Hence, remembering happens through aesthetic creations. In a troubling yet necessary intermediality, fiction writers and filmmakers become historians, historians rely on personal memories, psychoanalysts call upon literature, literary critics write with emotion. In its inclusion of protagonists from both sides of the War (often women who prove that war is not just a man's business), the seminar highlights the necessity of a synergy of memories, towards healing, reconciliation, and action.\n\n\nCourse Material:  Readings will include works of fiction and autofiction by Maïssa Bey, Hélène Cixous, Mohammed Dib, Zahia Rahmani, Leila Sebbar, Alice Zeniter; films by Yasmina Adi, Jacques Demi, Assia Djebar, Medine, Gillo Pontecorvo, Alain Resnais; essays and theories by Lia Brozgal, Albert Camus, Saidiya Hartman, Jill Jarvis, Karima Lazali, Frantz Fanon, Achille Mbembe, Jacques Derrida, Michael Rothberg, Benjamin Stora. \nRequired Books (to be purchased with indicated ISBN only.
