Nouvet / T Th 1:00-2:15pm\nContent:  Literature may ask us to cross into another world, another space and time which seem utterly disconnected from reality. Far from being simply unreal, this other world points in fact to another kind of reality: the psychic reality of fantasies and desires.  It is the various facets of this psychic reality (beyond or below what passes for \"reality\") that the genre of the \"conte\" explores as it moves from the world of Celtic legends, to the fairy tales of Perrault, and finally to the uncanny and anxiety-ridden experiences staged in 19th century \"contes fantastiques.\" \n \nTexts may include\nCharles Perrault: Contes [selections]\nGustave Flaubert: Trois contes\nGuy de Maupassant: Contes fantastiques [selections]\nVilliers de l'Isle-Adam: Contes cruels [selections]\nGautier: Contes et r√©cits fantastiques [selections]",
