Nouvet / T Th 2:30-3:45pm\nContent:  In the wake of World War I, the avant-garde movement known as \"surrealism\" proposed not just a new aesthetic, but a new way of life devoted to the exploration of another kind of reality, the psychic reality that psychoanalysis had discovered. This exploration, as we shall see,  was undertaken in multiples genres (painting, photography, photomontages, literature, movies) and through collaborative projects.  As they proposed new ways of looking at reality which influenced later artists, the surrealist also looked backwards.  They identified their precursors, visionary writers  (Apollinaire, Rimbaud and Nerval) and painters (Bosch) that inspired them and that we will also study. \n \nTEXTS may include: \nEluard:Capitale de la douleur [selections] \nBreton: Nadja \nManifestes du surréalisme \nValentine Penrose: Dons des Féminines  [selections] \nErnst: La femme 100 têtes \nDali: La vie secrète de Salvador Dali \nEluard et Ray: Les mains libres \nNerval: Aurélia \nApollinaire:     Alcools             [selections] \nRimbaud: Illuminations [selections]",
