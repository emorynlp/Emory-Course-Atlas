Many of the works we will read and critically analyze include oral expressions, essays, memoirs, poetry, short stories, and a novel. The class will highlight diverse literary perspectives to obtain a broad understanding of early American literature and cultures, their historical context, the texts' enduring significance and changing literary forms, and social and political tensions that emanated during the first centuries of American life. We will pay attention to how authors view and make sense of the (new) environment, themselves, the people they encounter, divergent spiritual worldviews, and the role of women. \nRequired Texts:\n-The Broadview Anthology of American Literature Volumes A and B\n-Hobomok. A Tale of Early Times (1824) by Lydia Maria Child",
