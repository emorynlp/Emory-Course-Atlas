    "class_notes": "Topic: African Literary Environments\n\n\nFrom Rob Nixon's Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor (2011) through Cajetan Iheka's African Ecomedia: Network Forms, Planetary Politics (2021) to even more recent work, the field of African literary and cultural studies is undergoing an environmental turn. How are anticolonial and other freedom struggles related to environmental justice? How do texts represent the entanglement of humans with their more-than-human environments? Engaging with Africanist and ecocritical scholarship, this seminar will ask questions such as these of literary and cultural texts by African writers. A likely, although not exhaustive list, includes novels by Chinua Achebe, Bessie Head, and Yvonne Vera; poetry by Niyi Osundare, Tjawangwa Dema, and Togara Muzanenhamo; a memoir by Binyavanga Wainaina; and films by Wanuri Kahiu. (This course requires prior experience with literary analysis, so graduate students in programs other than English should contact the instructor before enrolling.)",
