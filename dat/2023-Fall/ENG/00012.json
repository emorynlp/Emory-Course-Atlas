    "class_notes": "Topic: Imagining Asian America\n\n\nCourse Description: This course provides a general introduction to the study of Asian American literature and culture through the politics of fantasy and from a global framework. Instead of taking \"Asian America\" as a given, we will explore its construction by tracing how \"Asia\" and \"America\" have been imagined separately and together. Placing these fantasies in relation to histories of immigration, imperialism, militarism, and globalization, we will investigate how Asian American writers and artists engage with and intervene in the imagining of Asian America. Throughout, we will pay special attention to the racial fantasies that adhere to everyday objects, including food, fashion, toys, media, and other forms of popular culture. Texts will range from the classic to the contemporary and encompass fiction, poetry, nonfiction, comics, and other media. \nTopics to be discussed will include: Orientalism and the yellow peril; the model minority; stereotyping and microaggressions; media representation; racial fetishism; drag and racial performance; interracial romance; refugee politics; intergenerational memory; techno-Orientalism; globalization and soft power; kawaii culture; weebs and fandoms.",
