    "class_notes": "This writing-intensive course provides students with an introduction to Shakespeare's dramatic works across four genres (history, comedy, tragedy, and romance). We will contextualize Shakespeare's career as a dramatist by reading his work against the backdrop of early modern London's vibrant, commercial theatre scene and the sociopolitical climate of Tudor-Stuart England. We will consider his works as texts to be read and plays to be performed by tracing the textual and performance history of select plays while also analyzing the distinctly literary aspects of Shakespeare's dramatic work. And we will explore Shakespeare's complex and enduring influence over literature, film, culture, and everyday life. Assignments include a passage analysis, a performance review, a renaissance-style commonplace book, and regular reading responses.",
