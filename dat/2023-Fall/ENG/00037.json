How do writers portray historical violence and grief without compromising the actual experience of events? In Seamus Heaney's words, \"What do I say if they wheel out their dead?\" We will begin by examining Yeats's responses to the demands of violent conflict and then focus on certain historical experiences as they become material for art: the effects of colonization in Ireland, the Easter Rising of 1916, the Civil War, and the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  Students will discuss the relationship between art and violence, poetry and politics, memory and commemoration. Selected writers: Boland, Carson, Flynn, Heaney, Longley, Mahon, McConnell, Morrissey, Yeats.",
