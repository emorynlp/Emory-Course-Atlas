The course is genre-comprehensive, including major works of poetry, drama, and prose. We will adopt a broadly historicist approach, considering texts within the political, economic, and social contexts in which they were produced. This approach, however, will not exclude attention to the formal and thematic qualities of individual works or the relevance of Renaissance texts to the present day. Topics to be discussed include Renaissance humanism, the Protestant Reformation, the political power of women, early colonialism, love and sexuality, and the Elizabethan stage.",
