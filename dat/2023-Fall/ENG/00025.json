This course will focus on perspectives of social change within the South, and the unique historical, social, and cultural factors that shape specifically Southern theatrical voices. Students will write responses to class readings, write analytical and research essays on Southern issues, and explore creative projects inspired by the topics discussed in class. Recurring topics of discussion will be racial representation, religion, and the artistic use of progressive voices within conservative environments. As a class, we will strive to define what, socially, culturally, or geographically, The South actually is.",
