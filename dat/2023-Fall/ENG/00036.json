We will read poetry, fiction, drama, and criticism from movements including high modernism, Harlem Renaissance, Chicago Renaissance, and proletarian literature. Some of the writers we read may include Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, Franz Kafka, Jean Toomer, William Faulkner, Zora Neale Hurston, Bertolt Brecht, and Ralph Ellison. We will consider the tumultuous historical context of the early twentieth century, and the impact of World War I, Great Migration, Bolshevik Revolution, Roaring Twenties, Great Depression, and World War II on writers' understanding of history. We will explore how these historical conditions both constrained and motivated writers' thinking about the modern and the utopian.",
