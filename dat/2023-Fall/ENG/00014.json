Selections from heroic and religious poetry and prose will begin with the first known poem in the English language and will include the Wanderer and Seafarer, the Battle of Maldon, the Dream of the Rood, Ã†lfric's preface to Genesis, and King Alfred's lament over the faded glory of English learning. We will also read Beowulf in translation and consider its reemergence in the 19th century as an antiquarian curiosity to its status today as a cultural icon. Classes consist of prepared translation, short lectures, and discussion. The standard lexicographic and bibliographic tools in Old English will be covered. \nRequirements: Grammar and translation quizzes, Power Point project, final examination.",
