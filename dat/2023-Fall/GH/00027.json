    "course_description": "Prerequisites: Second year global health students only. This course is specifically designed for those who will be working in developing countries and/or countries in economic and political transition-working in the public sector, the non-governmental sector, the community or international organizations. In this course, we focus on two primary resources in any organization or program-people and money-and the processes leading to high performance and quality. While derived from management theory and practice, the focus of this course is less on theory and more on application. This course focused on increasing your ability to analyze, explain and diagnose managerial and organizational dilemmas and generate solutions that are feasible. This will be done primarily through cases, group discussions and exercises. Lectures will provide background and theory.",
