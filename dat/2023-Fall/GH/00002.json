Health systems are the primary vehicles through which countries deliver health services to their populations. The course aims to equip students with an understanding of how responsibility, authority and accountability for health systems is created and managed, and how health systems are financed and administered, including the roles and implications of private sector involvement and profit in health systems. And the course examines the complex challenges of measuring the performance of health systems, with special attention to the distinction between equality and equity as organizing concepts for improving the fairness and effectiveness of health systems.",
