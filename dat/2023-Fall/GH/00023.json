    "course_description": ": This course focuses on the history and current state of global mental health. The goal of this course will be to explore global influences and cultural variances of mental health. We will explore these effects on incidence and prevalence, early identification and intervention, access to care, and measurement and evaluation. Social determinants of mental health and mental illness will be reviewed with emphasis on low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This course will also focus on closing gaps to mental health care globally, with specific focus on promising practices for mental health promotion and illness prevention, and the adaptation and application of psychological treatments in LMICs.",
