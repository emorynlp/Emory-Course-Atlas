This course aims to develop basic understanding of the analysis of time-to-event data. The concepts to be introduced include survival functions, hazard rates, right censoring, interval censoring, left truncation, and competing risks. Methods of focus are Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests, Cox proportional hazards regression models, and parametric regression models. Students will learn how to implement standard survival analysis methods using R and appropriately interpret results.",
