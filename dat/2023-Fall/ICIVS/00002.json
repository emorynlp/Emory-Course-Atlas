It is largely associated with the Sufi theologian Ibn Arabi (died 1240) and his followers. Informed by Neo-Platonism and sharing features with Christian and Jewish mystical writing and also with Hindu Vedanta, the Oneness of Being tradition was hugely influential in the Islamic world after the Mongol conquest. The ideas of Ibn Arabi permeated mystical theology, poetry, architecture, painting and music from Morocco to Malucca.)",
