We will discuss the theological, political, and cultural commitments and debates that have shaped Catholicism over centuries. Throughout the semester, we will explore these questions not only by looking to history, but also by analyzing a number of contemporary issues including gender and sexuality, the environment, and bioethics. As we explore these various aspects of modern Catholicism, we will engage a number of resources including official church documents, theological texts, art and literature, and ritual.",
