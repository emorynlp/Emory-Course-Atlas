Some subscribe to official religions and try to follow prescribed rituals of faith and devotion, whereas others tend to view themselves as more \"spiritual but not religious.\" In this course, we will read and reflect on several memoirs from diverse religious traditions in order to better understand the relationships between religion, self, and society. In addition to reading others' memoirs, students will be required to write about their own lives and relationship with the divine.",
