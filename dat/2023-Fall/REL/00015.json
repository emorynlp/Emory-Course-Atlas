Fiercely contested only thirty years ago, today gender and sexuality are considered key categories to understand the Nazi crimes. This course will explore how social understandings of gender norms and human sexuality affected the lives of perpetrators, bystanders, and victims. Using primary sources such as Nazi laws and propaganda, diaries, memoirs, and video testimonies, we will examine where men's and women's experiences mirrored one another and where they differed, as well as the ways in which the Nazi system redefined-and in some cases shattered-traditional gender roles. We will begin with an examination of gender and sexuality in Nazi ideology and everyday life in the Third Reich, then move on to the study of gendered experiences during the genocide, in ghettos and camps, and conclude with looking at how gender lens impacts memory and representations of the Holocaust. The themes covered will include the role of gender and sexuality in Nazi ideology, gay and transgender lives under Nazism, sexual violence, forced sterilization and reproductive rights, female perpetrators, and the link between homosocial male bonding, performative masculinity, and genocide.",
