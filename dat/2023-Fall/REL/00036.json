We will examine women's presence and power in African diasporic religious communities, feminine deities like Osun and Yemoja in the Ifá/Orisa tradition, and women's resistance to male-dominated religious spaces. Students will also explore how the gender binary is disrupted through rituals like possession, where the gender expression of the deity transforms the gender of the mounted person. Additionally, they will learn about gods known as queer, trans, or patrons of LGBTQI+ individuals. Course texts include academic studies of African diaspora religions as well as books written by religious practitioners. There will also be opportunities to attend community events and speak with local practitioners.",
