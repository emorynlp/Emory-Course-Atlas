If yes, how does nature achieve the category of sacred? When? Can one person make nature sacred, or is sacred nature the product of collective negotiation and categorization. In this course, students will explore nature, the natural, and sacred as concepts as well as how they are deployed as variables to consider nature sacred. Readings of texts both written and natural will lead to discussions about these negotiations of nature and sacred. Students and faculty in the course will explore on the one hand the role played by the sacred in processes of nature preservation / condemnation and, on the other, the role played by the natural in processes of canonization and forging of 'The Sacred.'",
