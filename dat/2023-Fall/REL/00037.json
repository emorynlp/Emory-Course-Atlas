We begin by thinking about masks and identities-the nature of pretending and the suspension of disbelief, with special reference to \"lifestyle fantasy\" and cosplay. What does it mean to \"identify with\" a character in a story? Is there something inherently \"moral\" about reading fantasy or science fiction? Can fantasy be a spiritual practice? Miracles, invisible beings, super powers, magical objects, and life after death: what is the relation of our real lives to these miraculous possibilities? The theme of the boundary between different \"worlds\" (ways of being, ways of thinking) is picked up in fiction by Neil Gaiman, Paul Cornell, Lord Dunsany, Sylvia Townsend Warner, and others. \"This\" world and \"that\" world function as metaphors for many kinds of boundaries: foreign/native, language, race, gender, class.",
