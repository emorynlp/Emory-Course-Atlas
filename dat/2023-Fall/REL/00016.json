It meets for two synchronous 75-minute sessions per week on MW.\nThis course satisfies the Religion major requirement: - Theme, Region. \nCan religion be entertaining? Can entertainment be religious? How have religions used entertainment to draw in followers? How has entertainment siphoned-off followers from traditional religions? These will be the driving questions of the course, and be explored historically, globally, but primarily in terms of American culture. Our conceptual framework for these explorations will come from Religious Studies and incorporate various other disciplines to interpret and better understand this fairly understudied but clearly relevant dynamic.",
