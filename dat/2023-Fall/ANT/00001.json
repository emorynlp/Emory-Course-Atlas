We will achieve this ambitious goal by investigating humanity through the four fields of Anthropology: Biological Anthropology, Archaeology, Linguistic Anthropology, and Cultural Anthropology. We will begin by looking at what it means to be human through the eyes of Biological Anthropology and Archaeology, specifically by looking at our biology, our evolution, our prehistory, and our relationships with other non-human primates. Following this, we will then explore how Cultural Anthropologists and Linguistic Anthropologists understand humanity, specifically by looking at how we organize our lives (through our subsistence, relationships, and systems of power), and how we symbolically express this organization (through language, art, religion). Through these multiple lines of inquiry, we hope to create a coherent and holistic picture of ourselves.",
