We will introduce rhetorical analysis as a method for understanding how quantitative information can be interpreted and conveyed for a variety of audiences, from professional researchers to the lay public. Guided by this knowledge, you will exercise strategies for communicating via text, speech, and visuals that are integral to preparing genres like research reports, informative and persuasive infographics, technical instructions, translations, and user-selected or user-generated data sets. While adapting these genres and their conventions for our goals, we will emphasize what methodological questions to ask when analyzing and writing about data, in addition to how and where to ask them. As you gain comfort with thinking of writing and analysis as intertwined exploratory pursuits, we will develop your facility with practices that center collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility. We will focus especially on how data are rhetorical and how these practices shape the impacts of our data-driven narratives.",
