    "course_description": "Bilingual class delivered in Spanish; writing can be submitted in English or Spanish. Course explores the effects of migration & displacement on the psychological, emotional, & spiritual well-being of Latinx people & communities. Migration is an experience that is characterized by people's uprooting & disruption of socio-cultural connections for the purposes of leaving one's home country to resettle in another. Such an experience evokes the pain & suffering associated with losses and relocation. Yet, when migration experiences are accompanied by other traumatic events (i.e., socio-political crisis, physical abuse, poverty, depression, war, discrimination, etc.), the difficulties and challenges migrant communities experience may reverberate for generations. Throughout this course, students will have the opportunity to explore the migration histories of their communities; the effects on their community functioning; and to propose specific strategies that may bring healing and growth.",
