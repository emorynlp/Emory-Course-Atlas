    "course_description": "This course will focus on key examples of the study of lived religion and material culture among a variety of US Latinx religious traditions. We will look at several short case studies including food traditions and visual/artistic/material traditions within specific Latinx communities to explore how studying material culture can give scholars greater insight into understanding lived religious experiences among Latinx folks. Students will gain tools to be conversant in the basic theories and methods that are used in studying religious material cultures and lived religions and learn how to apply them to the larger field of US Latinx religious history. This course will push students to expand ideas of what \"religion\" means within these communities and will encourage students to reflect on their own personal encounters with Latinx religious material cultures. The course will encourage a creative project within the student's community as the final project with also a final paper option.",
