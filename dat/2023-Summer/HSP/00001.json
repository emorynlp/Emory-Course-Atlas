It begins by examining the social, political, & theological events that gave rise to Latinx biblical interpretation & ends with how the questions Latinx scholars raise impact social, political, & theological questions.

Students will become familiar with the major themes of Latinx biblical interpretation, understand how Latinx scholars view the nature of texts, interpret texts, & use texts. At the end, students will be able place Latinx biblical interpretation in conversation with the broader field of biblical interpretation.",
