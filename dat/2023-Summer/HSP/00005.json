    "course_description": "Gustavo Gutiérrez speaks of the spiritual journey of God's people as the act of drinking from our own wells. This course explores Latinx communities' inner resources as practices that forge hope. It introduces students to theologies, philosophies and systems of hope and future within, but not limited to, the Christian tradition. We will talk about play and collective patterns in religious systems as well as the psychological implications for the individual. A sustainable hope refers to a hope that can be maintained and traditioned. We will look at questions such as, how does one flourish amid crisis and hardship? What are the implications of articulating a responsible and sustainable hope? How do we engage a plurality of religious traditions in collaboration with materializing hope? At the end of the class the student should be able to define and map a system of hope for their religious/spiritual context.",
