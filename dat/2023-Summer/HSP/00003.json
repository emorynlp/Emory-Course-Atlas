This course follows a Christian Russian tradition called Sacred Fools and intends to be a practical-theoretical way of engaging humor, laughter and foolishness through play in worship and preaching forms. The course will take on Latinxs resources of laughter, humor and foolishness. Together, we will engage play as a fundamental way of living our faith and daily lives in our communities.",
