    "course_description": "Since its very beginnings Christianity has struggled with materiality. Across history the 'material' has been opposed (and many times relegated), for instance, to the \"doctrinal\", \"biblical\", & \"spiritual\". However, for local Christianities, & especially in Latinx contexts, the divine, the human, the world, & everything in between are meaningful through material religion, that is, relational faith through images, objects, spaces, & practices. Yet many Latinxs are intensely religious & nuanced reflections & critiques have developed regarding these beliefs & practices under the rubric Latinx theology. By exploring Latinx scholarship on material religion (Alonso, Scheper-Hughes, Castañeda-Liles, Varela Ríos, & others) & concepts these scholars have articulated (e.g., anti-consumerism, affect, decoloniality, & gender), we will explore how core Latinx theological understanding (around sacramentality, devotion, or theological anthropology) can be enriched by a material-religious approach.",
