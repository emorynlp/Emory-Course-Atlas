The challenges confronting firms competing in today's dynamic environment demand a multi-disciplinary focus. As we prepare students who seek to understand and face these challenges, this course covers the multiple activities comprising a firm's operating core and its supply chain. The operating core of a firm is an integrated system that combines activities related to design and engineering, production, quality management, networks of material and information flows, and the development, distribution and delivery of goods and services to customers.",
