Immigration, missions, nation-building, music, urbanization, oppression, gender politics, civil religion, solitary seekers, social experimentation, and consumer culture, it's all there, and more.  Religious lives and practices reflect a broad array of circumstances, communities, and commodities.  Materials and discussions in this course will cover both so-called religious traditions in the American context (Hinduism, Judaism, Native American, and so on), and less recognized but just as vital religious cultures alive and thriving in the American context. This online course will also address conflicting definitions of religion at work in American history, and question lines of authority and power in making distinctions between real religion and false religion.",
