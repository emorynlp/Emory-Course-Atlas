    "class_notes": "Topic:  When Less is More: English Short Fiction, Modern to Contemporary\nIn this Maymester course, we will ask: what happens when we look at short stories not as workshops for lengthier accomplishments but rather as artistic achievements that can only be realized in this economical and exciting form? We will read a few stories by a new writer every day, moving from the turn of the twentieth century to works written in the last few years. As we explore the modernist and contemporary short story in Britain and beyond, we'll keep two objectives in mind: 1) to familiarize ourselves with some of the genre's important critical vocabulary; and 2) to see how modernist and contemporary writers of global English literature stretched the limits of what stories can do, deliberately complicating their epiphanies through abstraction, ambiguity, subversion, and provocation. The stories we read will touch upon the major currents of 20th- and 21st-century history and life, bridging the everyday and the extraordinary. We will read a diverse set of writers, including some of the following: Thomas Hardy, Oscar Wilde, Katherine Mansfield, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, Muriel Spark, Alan Sillitoe, Graham Greene, Sam Selvon, Doris Lessing, Angela Carter, Salman Rushdie, Ali Smith, Zadie Smith, Kazuo Ishiguro, Jackie Kay, and Hanif Kureishi.",
