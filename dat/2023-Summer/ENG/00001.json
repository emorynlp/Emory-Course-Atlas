    "class_notes": "Topic-Flannery O'Connor\nCourse Description: \nO'Connor is one of the most talked about Christian fiction writers in America. However, she is not your typical Christian writer (if such a person exits). Her work is challenging. She examines what can be sensitive subjects: violence, pain, brutality, death, abuse, and all of these in connection with a spiritual sensibility. O'Connor's narratives give us insight into understanding the mysterious narratives of humans in all their beauty and ugliness and how those narratives connect in the most grotesque ways with notions of the Divine. Your teacher won't have all the answers when it comes to O'Connor, so students' contributions will be essential to the learning in the class. You will discover O'Connor's keen wit and morbid humor along the way. We will read a great deal of O'Connor's fiction and non-fiction, watch some adaptations of her work, study her influence, and consider some critical material as well. O'Connor's writing will connect with the gothic literary tradition in America (and why she disliked that term) and with other writers of her time period, including those from the famous Iowa Writer's Workshop. We will also certainly consider her as a writer in the Southern tradition.",
