    "class_notes": "Topic: Arthurian Literature \nCourse Description: The historical Arthur probably had a Roman father and a Celtic mother. As King of the Britons he combated the Angles and the Saxons, the very people who became the English and who claimed without irony--their former adversary as a national hero. The Britons, the English, and the French then created the corpus of Arthurian legend that continues to grow today. We will read a range of medieval and modern texts in order to understand how this legend defines the mythic imagination and how the legend explores fate and free will, heroes and heroines, the supernatural, courtly love, chivalry, and the origin of evil.",
