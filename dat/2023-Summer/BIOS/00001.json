    "course_description": "BIOS 518D is the follow-up to BIOS 517D. This course starts with ANOVA and ANACOVA and post-ANOVA multiple comparison procedures for cross-sectional data. It then introduces students to longitudinal data analysis. As in previous courses, students first learn to create descriptive and graphical summaries appropriate to longitudinal data prior to conducting formal inference. Students are introduced to multilevel models and extend the methods to more complex analytic situations that involve curvilinear and discontinuous growth trajectories and complex risk profiles, the inclusion of time-varying covariates, and the testing of complex interactions among time-invariant and time-varying predictors.",
