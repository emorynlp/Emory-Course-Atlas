We will begin by defining trust and autonomy, examining their respective roles in bioethics. We will critically analyze the claim that the prevailing notion of autonomy is incompatible with trust and develop a solution to the \"Trust-Autonomy Puzzle.\" Through case studies, philosophical arguments, and real-world examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of the value of trust and autonomy and how they can be mutually reinforcing. By the end of the course, we will be equipped with analytical tools to navigate complex ethical dilemmas and promote both trust and autonomy in personal and professional contexts.",
