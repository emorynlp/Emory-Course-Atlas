    "class_notes": "Thought experiments are hypothetical situations in which scenarios, principles, hypotheses, and theories are considered to assess their implications, applications, and potential consequences. While these situations are hypothetical, their impact on scholarship in ethics and philosophy is very real. Using our imaginations to \"test\" moral theory challenges our basic ethical notions and allows for forecasting responses to situations we may face in the future. In this course we examine classic and modern thought experiments by applying them to bioethical issues, identifying their advantages and shortcomings, and evaluating their role in bioethical decision-making.",
