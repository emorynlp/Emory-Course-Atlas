In a student's first semester of undergraduate research, while the student is learning the techniques of the lab, and becoming familiar with the project, they should enroll in Chem 399R. In subsequent semesters, when they are more experienced, research credit is given through Chem 499R. To find a research mentor to start doing research in the department, please look at individual faculty members websites, and find people who are doing things that interest you. Research requires a significant time commitment, and you need to be passionate about your area in order for the experience to be rewarding for both you and your research advisor. If you wish to receive credit in the department for research performed outside of the department you must submit a petition to your DUS, Dr. Kindt, no later than a week before the semester begins.",
