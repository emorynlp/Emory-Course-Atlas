Case studies include cloning, surrogacy, abortion and transplants. Our primary focus will be on how science is adapted in different cultural and religious settings, through both ethnographic, religious and medical ethics writings. No prior background necessary but this course is best for upper level undergraduates, especially those with an interest in religion, anthropology and health sciences. Special focus on Judaism and Catholicism with material on Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism as well. Come, and challenge your assumptions about life, death, human reproduction and faith!\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
