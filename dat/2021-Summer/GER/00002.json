    "class_notes": "Berlin has been the site of Germany's most progressive and revolutionary artistic developments. It has also been the center of the consolidated Nazi power and horrific planning of the Holocaust. This course traces major events and changes in Berlin's rich cultural history in the twentieth and twenty-first century through the study of primary sources (literature, art, film) and secondary materials (online resources, interviews with scholars and artists, and supplemental readings). Specifically, we will draw on weekly film screenings, short narratives, and virtual field trips to neighborhoods, memorials, and museums in order to explore the capital's divergent history and intricate present. Student will write two short response papers; give a presentation on a Berlin-based activist, artist, or politician; and complete a group project on one Berlin neighborhood. Successful completion of the course will make you eligible for a (partly funded) short study trip to Berlin in 2022 for which initial planning has begun.\nPrerequisite: GER 202 or equivalent\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
