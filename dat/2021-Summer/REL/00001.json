This introductory course will give students a taste of some of the history of the study of religion, which is not as boring as it sounds. The historical knowledge we acquire will frame and inform a much more entertaining endeavor: challenging contemporary conventional conceptualizations of religion in academia, politics, media, and society more broadly and generally. In addition, and even more potentially scandalous, will be our efforts to find and analyze religious life and cultures as they relate not to institutions and scriptures, but to other sacred sources of meaning today, like popular cultures or drugs.\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.\n\n\nThis course satisfies the new Religion major requirement: - Theme.",
