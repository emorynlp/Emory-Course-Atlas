    "class_notes": "Writing for Games - How does interactivity open up possibilities for storytelling?  Students in Writing for Games explore that question by playing narrative-focused games and interactive stories, reading critical and technical literature about mechanics and story structure in interactive fiction, and experimenting with our own writing. We also explore how different authors and authorship systems use interactive mechanics to further traditional goals of storytelling like communication, engagement, and empathy.\n\n\nThis is a Maymester online course. Due to the compressed three-week format, you may not enroll in a Maymester course (May 17- June 4) and a  course in the first session (May 17-June 26). You may enroll in a course during the second session.\n\n\nEmory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
