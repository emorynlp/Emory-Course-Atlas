    "class_notes": "Explores the repressions of the Soviet totalitarianism through the experience of those who lived through it.  Taking a humanistic approach towards such traumatic historical events as the Stalin Revolution, the Terror Famine, forced labor camps (the Gulag), the Great Terror, and the Cult of Personality, this course will focus on autobiography, memoirs, letters, diaries and other, deeply personal texts to understand how average Soviet citizens dealt with the repercussions of Stalinism.  While excellent background works such as Figes, The Whisperers will be provided, our primary source material in the class will be on witnesses to this history, not its interpreters.  We will read texts or excerpts from persons as diverse as a Kazakh nomad and a Gulag camp commandant, the diary of a Communist true believer and the diary of a rebellious schoolgirl, the account of a political prisoner (zek) and the interviews of an architect of terror.  We will also sample contemporary (and later) film, poetry and fiction to understand the heavy burden Soviet citizens bore for living in the first socialist society.  Too often the story of Stalinism is reduced to vast generalities and stereotypes of a soulless state machine that ground down an atomized society.  In fact, each event of repression, each grandiose project or mind-numbing statistic related to real people, both as victims and perpetrators (not rarely, both).\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
