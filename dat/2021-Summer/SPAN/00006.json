    "class_notes": "This course focuses on developing both cultural understanding and linguistic skills. It explores cultural issues in the Hispanic world, such as diversity, gender roles and power structures through writing about and discussion of written texts and films. These texts also serve as the basis for practicing Spanish vocabulary and grammar in context, as well as honing listening, speaking, and particularly, reading and writing skills. By the end of the course, students should be able to use critical thinking skills in Spanish to interpret and discuss literature and film in Spanish, gain advanced proficiency in reading and writing the language, and gain knowledge of significant historical events.) (PARTICULARS: Evaluation is based on active class participation, writing assignments, an oral presentation, exams and completion of online assignments and homework assignments. Movie screenings will be required outside of class. This course may be appropriate for heritage speakers in consultation with the Director of the Spanish Language Program.) (PREREQUISITES: SPAN 202 or official placement into SPAN 212. Take online exam at http://spanport.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/placement/index.html\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
