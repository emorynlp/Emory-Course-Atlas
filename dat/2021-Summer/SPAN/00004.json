    "class_notes": "This course is a continuation of Spanish 201 and is designed to further develop students' Spanish skills. Students refine their grammar usage through continued review of basic structures and study of complex structures, and they expand their spoken Spanish skills through discussion and analysis of cultural topics, personal experiences, and literary and journalistic texts. Students are provided ample opportunity for focused listening through use of recorded texts (conversations, music, video) and for oral expression through general classroom and small-group discussions and oral reports. Readings in the course focus on both historical and current cultural and social issues in the Hispanic World. Writing is also developed as a communicative endeavor, with emphasis on the preparation of written compositions/reports based on the cultural components of the course.) (PREREQUISITE: Spanish 201 or permission of the Director of Placement.)\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
