    "course_description": "The role of the Informatician and Informatics is to drive technology to a successful outcome supporting Public Health (PH) science and practice. To this end, both the science/practice and technology domains must be understood building enough breadth to be effective leading the deployment of an informatics solution. The Public Health Technology Systems and Architecture course is designed to give the informatics student more breadth in the technology domain around computing. One must understand enough about modern computing and data systems to partner with the IT/IS professionals to make sure an appropriate design and successful deployment of the technology meets the needs of the PH process and outcomes. This course provides a functional exposure from the basic ideas of computing through complex human interactions with technology and architectures that we base our modern systems upon to serve the current and future requirements in public health.",
