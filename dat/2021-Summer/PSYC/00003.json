(\"The ways individuals interact with the world and with each other change dramatically from birth to adolescence. The first goal of Child Development is to trace changes during infancy, the preschool years, middle childhood, and adolescence in the domains of cognition, language, social behavior, and self concept. The second goal of the course is to examine the factors that influence the course of development, including heredity and the social, cultural, family, and physical environment.\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
