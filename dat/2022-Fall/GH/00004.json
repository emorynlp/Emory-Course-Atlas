    "course_description": "GH 513 provides an introduction to Community-based Participatory Action Research (CBPAR), and similar research approaches ones that are community-based and community-centered, participatory in their inclusion of community members as protagonists, and action-oriented in the sense that they explicitly seek to promote change. Students will develop familiarity with a range of classical and innovative research approaches, including assets-based approaches such as appreciative inquiry and critical approaches such as autoethnography. The course will be divided roughly in half, with the first half being more instructor-guided and the second half, student-generated and led.",
