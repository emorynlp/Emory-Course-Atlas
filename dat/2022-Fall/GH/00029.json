The purpose of this methodology course is to provide learners with theoretical background, technical and critical thinking skills, and practical experience to conduct a health-related community assessment in a \"Glocal\" context and through a community engaged and asset-based process. The Community Health Assessment (CHA) is a vital planning tool to identify priority health assets, capacities and needs, target resources to address health inequalities and meaningfully involve stakeholders at the level of families, communities and/or populations in the assessment process. During the course of the semester learners will work intensively in small groups to produce a CHA using a rapid methodology. Class time is divided between lecture and lab time.",
