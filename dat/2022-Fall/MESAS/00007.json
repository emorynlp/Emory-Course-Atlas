We will consider the ways Islam, its prophet, and peoples are represented in the media, and how this representation has changed over time. Readings and media examples focus on the perceived clash between Islam and the West and explore how images reflect their historical contexts and feed stereotypes and misconceptions. These representations, positive as well as negative, are part of a complex web of history and politics.",
