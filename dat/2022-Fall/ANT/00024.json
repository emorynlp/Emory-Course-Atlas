We will discuss topics including healthcare, public and population health, reproduction, birth, disability, mental illness, death, and end of life care. Following an introduction to creative anthropological approaches and bioethics, we will spend each week analyzing and evaluating anthropological texts alongside more creative work including creative nonfiction, fiction, graphic novels, poetry, film, performance, podcasts, and art. We will consider what role these materials and approaches do and should play in anthropology and in contexts outside of the academy. Students will develop final projects of their choosing as we collectively contribute to an accessible classroom.",
