    "class_notes": "This graduate seminar explores current ethnographic work on subjective experience and mental well-being in cross-cultural perspective, with a focus on global mental health, selfhood, morality, disability, embodiment, and contemplative practice. This seminar is especially appropriate for, but not limited to, individuals interested in psychological and psychiatric anthropology. In recent years, anthropologists have been increasingly interested in exploring agency and internal subjective experience in addition to and in relation to social, political and economic structures. We will critically engage selected monographs to examine what these authors successfully accomplished from their ethnographic methods and conceptual approaches, and where they encountered limitations and challenges. \nThe format of the seminar will include: (1) weekly presentations that are led by one or two students; (2) weekly responses to the class discussion and presentation from the previous week; (3) a final paper on an approved topic.",
