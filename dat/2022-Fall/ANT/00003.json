We will trace debates in cultural anthropology and political ecology to examine how humans understand, engage, and interact with and through their environments. This course does not offer a biological approach to the study of ecosystems; rather it draws on the social sciences and humanities to explore the diversity of ways in which people have conceptualized the environment and environmental issues, and the politics that have structured this diversity.  A primary focus will be on theories about the relationship between people, nature, place and the cultural forms through which they interrelate. \nWe will ask: How do different groups of people around the world understand the relation between human/non-human, nature/culture, and why does this matter? How have understandings of basic elements of human existence 'land, water, and air' varied across time and place? How do diverse groups manage their environment through social and political organization, subsistence and social practice, and technological innovation? And how are people around the world and here in Atlanta experiencing, producing, and fighting against toxicity, climate change, and environmental degradation? Students will participate in short on-campus field trips to explore their own situatedness in place, nature, and environmental practice.",
