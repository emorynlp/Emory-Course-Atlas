One of the primary objectives of the course is to develop an understanding of the enormous range of variation in human societies regarding gender roles and the constructions and entailments of femininity, masculinity, heteronormativity, gender variance, and same-sex erotics, particularly in relation to axes of difference and inequality associated with race, class, and religion. We begin with early anthropological debates (from the 1970s) on \"the status of women\", the prevalence of male dominance, and the ways scholars involved in these debates drew upon 19th- and early 20th-century theorists (e.g., Marx, Engels, Freud, and Levi-Strauss) to frame both their research questions and their contributions to these debates. We will continue with psychoanalytic approaches to cultures of masculinity and sexuality; queer feminist understandings of heteronormativity, same-sex sexuality and gender variance both \"at home\" and transnationally; and the contributions of Black feminist anthropology and intersectional perspectives on race, class, gender, and sexuality.",
