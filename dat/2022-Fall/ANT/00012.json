    "class_notes": "This course provides students with anthropological and interdisciplinary perspectives on contemporary Israeli and Palestinian societies. Through ethnographic explorations, we will emphasize the heterogeneity of these communities and how politics, religion, economics, psychology, and culture shape everyday lives in Israel/Palestine. In addition, students will advance their analytical and critical thinking skills, particularly in understanding debates on salient issues that animate the region and interrogating worldviews from across the ideological spectrum. By the end of the course, we will discern the central role of Israel/Palestine in global politics, and the stakes for people on the ground in this historic, conflicted, and beautiful land.",
