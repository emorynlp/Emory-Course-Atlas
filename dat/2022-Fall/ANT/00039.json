With the advent of social history in the 1970's, biography as a mode of engaging with the past, often associated with \"Big Man\" history, fell out fashion. It returned through the back door as historians sought to recover the experiences of marginalized people whose lives and histories have remained largely invisible. Source material provides the central challenge for this new mode since women, laborers, and African and Indigenous-descent communities often left little paper trail. Practitioners of the new biography compensate for these archival silences by resorting to different kinds of sources, repurposing older methods like microhistory, and embracing controversial approaches at the boundaries between history and fiction. We will read cutting-edge biographies that made a historiographical impact in their time, and newer work that continues to push the limits of the discipline.",
