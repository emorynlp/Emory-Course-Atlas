Topics include: Berry phase in crystals, electronic polarization, adiabatic electronic transport and quantization of transport, obstructed atomic insulators, quantum Hall effect, Chern insulators, quantum spin Hall effect, weak and strong topological insulators, axion insulators, topological superconductors and Majorana fermions, and applications of the theory to classical systems, such as photonic and acoustic crystals. To illustrate these phenomena, we will study the most paradigmatic models associated with these phases. A final project will let you explore topics of your own interest toward the end of the course.",
