The notion of good grammar makes most of us think of getting it right or being correct. However, grammar is all about choices, and these choices are made to forward your argument, help you find an audience, and make a difference with your writing. Grammatical choices are part of the writer's toolkit, helping the writer make meaning in collaboration with a reader. This class is fully online and asynchronous.",
