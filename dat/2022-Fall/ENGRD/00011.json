    "class_notes": "\"From what political perspective do we dream, look, create, and take action?\" asked bell hooks in her 1992 book \"Black Looks.\" Three decades later, Cathy Park Hong in \"Minor Feelings\" furthers the question: \"Who am I writing for?\" Both writers raise important questions for us: how do we represent ourselves and \"others\" through various media forms? How do words, images, and sounds inform, reform, or de-form identity and community? In this course, we are going to find the answers through closely reading discourses across genres on the intersections of gender and race in media representations. Students are expected to write an autoethnographic narrative and conduct a research project on media making of cultural identities. Through close reading and critical writing, we hope to seek ways to diversify our perspectives and, as bell hooks says, \"create a context of transformation\" for our media-saturated society.",
