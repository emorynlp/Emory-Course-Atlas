This course will focus on researching, analyzing and practicing English grammar in order to develop students' knowledge of form, meaning and usage, while providing continuous and responsive feedback. Through a variety of activities and texts we will study, practice and refine grammatical accuracy for the purpose of expressing clear and precise meanings. At times I will use lecture and focused activities to introduce specific grammar points that are important for additional language learners; in other lessons, students will discover the nuances of grammar usage by reading texts or using corpus linguistics; additionally, students will have ample opportunity to practice and apply what they have learned to revise and refine their own academic writing. We will look at both more serious global concerns that can affect a reader's general comprehension of the work (such as verb tense) and less serious local concerns that can result in an impreciseness of meaning (such as verb form). What are the choices we make as we construct meaning and how can different choices affect meaning?\nEnrollment by permission only from Jane O'Connor. Class to be taken with ENGRD 101. Other students may request the class.\nThis class meets on Wednesdays only.",
