    "class_notes": "This course examines the role of law in the construction of gender identities and the regulation of gender relations through feminist, queer, critical, intersectional and interdisciplinary engagements with legal rules and institutions. It will explore gender issues in the law and critically consider how the law both produces and regulates our sexual subjectivities and gendered selves. It will explore the role that the law and legal institutions play in creating and enforcing gender binaries. Beginning with an overview of the different theoretical frameworks that can be used to critically examine the relationship of gender and the law, it goes on to consider a range of substantive issues including reproductive rights, marriage, employment and criminal law.",
    "course_description": "This course explores the American legal system from a queer and feminist perspective, and asks how we might approach questions of gender, race, and sexuality in relation to justice.
