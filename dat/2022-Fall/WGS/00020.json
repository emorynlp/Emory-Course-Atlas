We will read texts by Frances Washburn, Deborah Miranda, Craig Womack, Beth Brant, Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm, Tommy Pico, Natalie Diaz, Cynthia Leitich Smith, and others. Readings will include poetry, fiction, and non-fiction. We will also regularly engage Native news media sources. These texts will lead us to discuss issues of sexual violence, colonialism, and heteropatriarchy impacting Indigenous people. They will also draw our attention to positive experiences of Indigenous sexuality and gender expression. Course requirements include reading, participation in class discussion, informal writing assignments, one short paper, one long paper, and small group conversational assessments at midterm and during our final exam period.",
