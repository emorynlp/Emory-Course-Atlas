What do all these Freudian terms mean, and what is their relevance for contemporary life?  The aim of this course is two-fold: (i) to introduce students to the core concepts of Freudian psychoanalysis, and (ii) to track these concepts in feminist and queer theory. The course presumes no prior knowledge of psychoanalysis and will provide the foundations for students who have interests in post-Freudian thinkers like Lacan, Klein, Winnicott etc. The course will begin with the central theoretical concepts in Freud's metapsychology: drives, repression, the unconscious, dream interpretation, the symptom.  We will be particularly interested in how psychoanalysis challenges the notion of a unified, conscious subject. In the second half of semester, the course will focus on the perverse and corporeal nature of infantile sexuality, and use this to investigate psychoanalytic accounts of adult sexuality and gender. In the final weeks of the course, we will survey some influential feminist and queer uses of Freud.\n\n\nDr. Wilson requests that the maximum enrollment for WGS 756 section-1 be increased from 6 to 8; Rm Cap Request from 12 to 14.",
