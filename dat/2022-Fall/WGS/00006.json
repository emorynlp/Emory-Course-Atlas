This seminar course will explore the events of the Stonewall Uprising and its aftermath, and how those events have been remembered and given meaning through the cultural agency of LGBTQ+ identifying people. Through its special focus on the Stonewall Uprising, the course will engage theoretical questions about historical and collective memory; the categories of  'legend,' 'myth,' and 'sacred story'; and the role of ritual performance in the commemoration of significant historical events. Particular attention will be given to how insights and ideas from the academic study of religion can illuminate the interpretation of the Stonewall Uprising and how investigation of such an apparently 'non-religious' event can contribute to the study of religion.",
