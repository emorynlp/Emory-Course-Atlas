Although marriage was the norm, a substantial number of women, by choice or by circumstance, delayed marriage or never married at all. We discuss the kinds of professions available to singlewomen, especially for those who migrated to big cities to find work or for enslaved women who were forced to migrate and labor for others. We will cover topics such as premarital sex, sexual assault, prostitution, same-gender desire, medical theories about the body, single motherhood, women's ability to contract their own marriages, widowhood, spousal abandonment, and single women building migrant communities in cities. This course queries what singlehood meant and addresses the social, economic, and religious pressures for women to marry or not marry.",
