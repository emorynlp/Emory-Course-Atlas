His vision and style were so innovative that a new adjective had to be coined: Felliniesque. In this course, we will tease out the meaning of this adjective by identifying, analyzing, and interpreting Fellini's artistic production in its aesthetic innovations and philosophical content while paying special attention to the Italian historical and cultural context of the post-war period. The course will be offered in conjunction with required in-class screenings, special events with guest speakers, and the exhibition \"Fellini and Fantasy\" hosted at the Carlos Museum which will display film scripts, photographs, program and press clippings, correspondence, and, most importantly, color drawings by Fellini representing characters or scenes eventually incorporated into his movies.",
