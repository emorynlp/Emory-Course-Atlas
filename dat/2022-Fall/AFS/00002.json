The religious traditions we will cover include: Regla de Ocha (Lucumi/Santeria), Reglas de Palo, Abakua, and Espiritismo. The course trajectory will take us from a history of the Caribbean focusing on Cuba to an in-depth analysis of the most well-known Orishas (deities) in Afro-Cuban religions. We will conclude by turning our attention to the ways Afro-Cuban religiosity is articulated through various forms of popular culture like music, film, literature, and art.",
