Some of the religious traditions we will cover include: Regla de Ocha (Lucumi or Santeria), Vodou, Regla de Palo, and Obeah. Attention will be given to historical processes that shaped how these religions developed in their diasporic contexts. In addition to obtaining a foundational understanding of the beliefs and practices associated with each tradition, we will consider some of the contemporary approaches to studying African heritage religions in the African diaspora.",
