Besides reading excerpts from Dante's classic sources like Vergil and Ovid, we will look at echoes of the Commedia in modern literature and culture, exploring, in particular, the way Inferno has been used to think and represent the modern metropolis and the expansion of capitalist society. While studying Dante's worldview and the geographical construction of a mental space, we will follow the translation of his work in different media and genres in contemporary receptions, from theater to the novel.",
