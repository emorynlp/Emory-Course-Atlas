This class will present a number of important modeling and prediction techniques that are staples in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science (more broadly).  Unlike a standalone machine learning class, special attention will be given to the statistical underpinnings of common methods.  This class will consist of 4 parts: \nA review of probability theory and an introduction to maximum likelihood estimation: probability theory review, Bayes' rule, maximum likelihood estimation, model fitting, model comparison, predictive accuracy, overfitting \nRegression as a predictive task and general model fitting: review of linear regression, cross validation and leave-one-out cross validation, bootstrapping, alternative prediction methods for continuous outcomes, sparse regression (Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net), non-linear methods, tree-based methods.\n\n\nClassification methods: K-nearest neighbors, na√Øve Bayes classifiers, linear discriminants, logistic regression, support vector machines, deep learning \nUnsupervised methods: Principal components analysis, clustering (generative and geometric), hierarchical clustering, factor analyzers, semi-supervised methods \nTo get the most out of this class, students should be comfortable with multivariable calculus and linear algebra.  Students should also have strong background knowledge of probability and a working knowledge of regression models.  As computing is a large part of this course, students should have experience programming in R and/or Python at the level of writing their own functions and working with potentially messy data.",
