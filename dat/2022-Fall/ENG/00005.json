This course will ask students to read novels, poetry, films, and music videos, analyzing themes like self-definition, collaboration, and sensual expression as meaningful components of Black feminist praxis. The texts will include works like Their Eyes Were Watching God, Sula, 'Four Women,' and 'Ego-Trippin.' Assignments will include weekly discussion posts, a research paper, and a final creative project.",
