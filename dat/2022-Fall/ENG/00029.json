The class will focus on how literary and scientific writers have explored the world in many senses, and how they have influenced one another with their different ways of observing, describing, and narrating. Students majoring in science, literature, creative writing, or any other field are encouraged to take this class, and no expertise in literary analysis or the natural sciences will be presumed. The readings will include works by Charles Darwin, Edgar Allan Poe, Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, Mary Shelley, Robert Louis Stevenson, Jules Verne, and H. G. Wells. Three short essays will be required. This course does not fulfill the continuing writing requirement.",
