Our subjects are the means and modes of textual production, from cuneiform clay tablets, to manuscripts on papyri and parchment, to the revolutions of the invention of paper and then of printing, and finally to ever-changing electronic medias.  Text and image have always been inseparably connected in all of these modes.  The course will feature visits with specialists in these fields to explore the variety of career opportunities available and to apply visual literacy skills to student futures.",
