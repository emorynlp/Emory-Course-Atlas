Do you read writing by women or non-Western writers differently? Why does art exist? If you think you'd like to discuss these questions, join us so we can talk about reading and writing practices and how both are embedded in historical and cultural contexts. We will read works by Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Marx, Walter Benjamin, Homi Bhabha, Judith Butler, Toni Morrison and a novella composed for Twitter feed by Pulitzer-prize winning author, Jennifer Egan. The primary goal of this course is to prepare you to write about literature with a clear methodology and purpose.",
