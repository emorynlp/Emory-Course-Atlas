In a highly mediatized environment where the boundaries between spectacle and reality often blur, the tasks of readers and critics are more challenging than ever. This class thus has both theoretical and practical aims. Approaching literature as at once part of human cultural and political life and an effort to reflect critically on the world it represents, we will read a series of classic plays in conversation with the work of significant critics and theorists.\nYou will actively engage with a wide range of practices of reading and writing about culture and the arts as we explore historically evolving models of the political and learn about different literary, critical, and theoretical strategies for representing and reflecting aesthetically on human collective life from Aristotle to the present. By helping you cultivate a longer perspective on the intertwined histories of theater, politics, and literary and cultural criticism, the class aspires to help you become a more incisive and thoughtful reader and critic in the future.",
