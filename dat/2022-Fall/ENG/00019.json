As novelist Anne Enright puts it, \"Ireland is a series of stories it tells itself. None of them are true.\" We will read a wide range of Irish authors including Oscar Wilde, W.B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, Eavan Boland, Brian Friel, and Seamus Heaney. There will be a particular focus on the Irish historical and political contexts relevant to these writers, and on the ways in which the imagined Ireland intersects with the `real' Ireland. Expect frequent writing posts, a midterm quiz, presentations, and a final project.",
