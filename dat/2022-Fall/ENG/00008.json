This course will explore the foundations and contemporary forms of \"queer reading,\" providing students an introduction to key issues related to the reading practices and literary communities formed around racial, sexual, and gender-based difference. We will pay special attention to the impact that the internet has had on the spread and performance of queer reading. Students will cultivate close-reading practices, writing strategies, and digital literacies engaging with texts from scholars, activists, writers, poets, and artists who have helped develop our concept of queer reading, like Audre Lorde, James Baldwin, Gloria Anzald√∫a, Zora Neale Hurston, and Toni Morrison, as well as contemporary media like Rupaul's Drag Race, Contrapoints, and Pose. We will also think about queer reading's global impact and increasing commodification in economic markets. Beyond weekly close (queer) reading assignments involving collaborative annotation, students will develop a final creative and multimodal research project delving into a topic or text of their choice",
