In the process, we will examine resonances, solidarities, and divergences among African and Black European literature and thought. Our reading will be equally diverse in terms of genre (poetry, novels, short stories, essays) and stylistic approaches, ranging from more familiar narrative frames to more experimental ones. Authors may include but will not be limited to: May Ayim, Bernadine Evaristo, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi, Katherine Oguntoye, Peggy Piesche, and Chika Unigwe.",
