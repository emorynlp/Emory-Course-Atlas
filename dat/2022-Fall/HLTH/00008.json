We will also look at the Roman era continuation of Greek medical traditions through the work and career of Galen of Pergamum. A major theme of the seminar will be understanding the contemporaneous emergence and continued success of Hippocratic medicine and Asclepian religion/cult, two distinct but related ways of thinking about health and healing. Emphasis will be on primary sources, both texts such as the Hippocratic writings and the testimonia of Asclepius' healing, as well as archaeological and material evidence from the sanctuaries of Asclepius located throughout the Greek world.",
