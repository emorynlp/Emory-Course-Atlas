This course considers the nature of paradigms and critically assesses how paradigms of health-focused systems develop, are maintained and change. The nature of evidence is interrogated and we consider the important influences of historical, social, political, economic, religious, ethical, cultural and psychological factors on how health-related issues become organized into belief systems, and critically assess the challenges confronting modification and advancement of health and health care theory, evidence and practice.",
