At the turn of the century, the Dalai Lama called for a holistic approach to education that cultivates, alongside traditional academic subjects, a compassionate and ethical mindset grounded in the basic human values that can be discerned from common sense, common experience, and science. He refers to this approach as 'secular ethics,' an approach to ethics that is not dependent on a particular belief system or religious framework but is inclusive of people with any or no religious affiliation. In 2019 the Center for Contemplative Science and Compassion-Based Ethics developed a secular ethics curriculum to carry out the Dalai Lama's vision, called Social, Emotional and Ethical (SEE) Learning.",
