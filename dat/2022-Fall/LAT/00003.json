Especial attention will be paid to poetic and narrative technique, his self-conscious position within the epic tradition, and how the text reflects or refracts contemporary socio-political contexts. Readings will be spread throughout the poem, allowing us to focus on passages of particular significance; the parts not read in Latin will be covered in translation. Assigned secondary scholarship will inform your understandings of the reading and provide a foundational basis for class discussion.",
