We will cover policy and translational implications and teach the underlying biological principles driving these analyses, laboratory methods involved, analytic approaches, and epidemiologic considerations. Upon completion of this course, students should be better equipped to read and interpret the scientific literature utilizing these methods and begin to consider how these approaches could be included in their own research.",
