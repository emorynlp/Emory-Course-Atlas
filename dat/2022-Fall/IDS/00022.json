How were popular understandings of citizenship and community relations transformed by the politics of race? This course will explore key themes in the history of race and migration in twentieth century Britain including: migration and refugee control, the relationship between welfare politics and migration, the political project of 'blackness' and the relationship between the black power organizations and the feminist movement. From the anti-colonial politics of the 1920s until the emergence of so-called multicultural society in the 1980s, we will take a transnational approach that will consider the British history of race and migration as a product of late and post-imperial politics.",
