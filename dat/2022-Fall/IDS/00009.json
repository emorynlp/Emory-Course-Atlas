Developing and communicating these models relies on textual, quantitative, and visual descriptions. Interactive visualizations enable people to tinker with and feel the influence of models' various parameters. This sidecar will focus on the creation of these interactive visualizations that enable people to explore quantum physics phenomena. No prior knowledge of physics or visualizations is necessary.",
    "course_description": "A side-car course brings together a subset of students from two courses that overlap in methodologies, topics, etc., to create a short interdisciplinary course that runs simultaneously with its two sponsoring courses. One credit, S/U only. Schedule and format arranged by sponsoring professors.",
