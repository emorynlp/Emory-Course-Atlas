The course consists of three thematic units: \n1.\tDie Natur im deutschen Bewu√ütsein: an exploration of the roots of German environmental consciousness by examining the portrayal of nature in select texts from the 18th to 20th century; \n2.\tUmweltschutz in der BRD und der DDR: 1950-2010: a chronological exploration of key developments in ecological awareness in both West and East Germany; \n3.\tGlobale und lokale Initiativen gegen den Klimawandel: a contemporary examination of current measures being undertaken to combat climate change, with a focus on both global initiatives (e.g., Paris Accords) and local efforts at the university and in Atlanta.\nFor the third thematic unit, students will engage in weekly synchronous telecollaborative meetings with university students in Bavaria, Germany to discuss and compare local environmental initiatives (not) being undertaken at the respective institutions and municipalities to address climate change and environmental injustice. These practices will also be discussed in terms of their reflection of larger cultural, societal, and political norms. This telecollaborative engagement will culminate in an online project to highlight both eco-friendly features of the respective localities as well as areas in need of environmental attention.\n\n\nTexts: \n-\tRequired course materials will be available via Canvas\n-\tAuf den Punkt Gebracht: Deutscher Lernwortschatz Zur Textarbeit.
