Taught by the German Studies Department's Fulbright Foreign Language Teaching Assistant, the course focuses primarily on spoken German, but all modalities (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) are covered. The topics for investigation and discussion are culturally significant aspects of the German-speaking world. Success in the course hinges on your active participation and engagement with the course materials and the other class participants. Prerequisite for 192: This course will be conducted in German and is open to students who have completed at least one semester of college-level German or the equivalent.",
