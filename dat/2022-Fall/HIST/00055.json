We will explore how questions on and about the past have come to be framed, and both the possibilities and occlusions that have unfolded within the guild of professional historians, including the relationship between history and other disciplines. Throughout we will consider: what are the topics historians should be working on in the twenty-first century? \nThis course is designed primarily for incoming Ph.D. students in the History Program. As we delve into the productions of history and some of the debates that have consumed scholars over the past few decades, we will also explore how the profession has developed and its current disciplinary organization.",
