Themes include the warriors' changing place in society; their fighting techniques at different historical junctions; their values as they transpire from the historical record versus the values that were retroactively attributed to them; warrior governments and strategies pertaining to power and authority; depictions of the samurai in literature, plays, and film; and the politicization of the military past. Previous knowledge of Japanese history and Japanese language skills welcome but not required.",
