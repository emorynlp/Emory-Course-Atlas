This class explores these questions by studying laboring populations of the 19th and 20th centuries in countries across the Americas. We will survey the range of experiences men and women had with phenomena like slavery, industrialization, and domestic labor, looking for similarities and differences in forms of oppression, resistance, and adaptation. We will also work toward an understanding of how class interacts with and is experienced through gender and racial identities. Students select from several possible final projects.",
