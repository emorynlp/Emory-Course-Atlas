How do ideals of US citizenship compare with historical realities?  How have social groups organized and mobilized for more expansive and inclusive citizenship?  What are the effects of current extreme economic inequality upon citizenship and representative democracy? Topics include voting rights, immigration policy, nationalism, consumerism, social justice, global citizenship, and the 2022 elections. \nThis discussion-based seminar draws upon a variety of source materials including the writings of historians, primary documents, critical essays, video documentaries, music and art of social protest, and contemporary internet resources.\nReadings include publications by Linda Kerber, Jill Lepore, Eric Foner, Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cohen, Maxine Hong Kingston, Martin Luther King, Jr., David Blight, Iris Marion Young, Juan Gonzalez, Claudio Saunt, Linda Greenhouse, Joseph Stiglitz.\nStudents are graded on class participation, reading commentaries and occasional quizzes, a semester paper (often drawn from family histories of migration and citizenship) and a final presentation.",
