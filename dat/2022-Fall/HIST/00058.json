Textbook narratives are wrong. This reading seminar examines the place of Japan in the world, and of the outside world in Japan, between 1600 and 1900. We will consider formal and informal diplomacy, intellectual exchanges, commerce, curiosity, contact spaces, and the issue of \"westernization.\" The assigned readings combine \"classics\" and recent scholarship. Japanese language skills and previous knowledge of Japanese history are welcome but not required.",
