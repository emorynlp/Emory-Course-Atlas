It begins with African civilizations in ancient times and runs through the 1880s, when the African continent was divided into European colonies. It concentrates on people and civilizations indigenous to Africa. The origins of Islam, the Atlantic slave trade, and European explorers and missionaries receive attention mainly in their African aspects. The emphasis on Africa in this course provides a valuable alternative perspective on these, and other, seemingly familiar events. We will read historical documents about Africa and produced by Africans. \nThe course ought to prove full of surprises: you will be privy to the newest and best historical findings about African history, its peoples and languages, as well as to unresolved areas and debates among historians.",
