Students will have the opportunity to work with an Atlanta artist and explore social justice issues relevant to the course topic.\n\n\nThis course will explore the global history of antisemitism from antiquity to the present.  Antisemitism is a modern term, but it has been used to describe a centuries-old fear that Jews somehow pose a threat to an existing social order.  It constitutes the oldest continuous global tradition of prejudice towards any single group defined as the \"Other.\" We will examine anti-Jewish prejudice in the realm of ideas and behaviors, attuned to changes in quality and intensity over time, and Jewish responses to violence and discrimination. We will explore the current rise of antisemitism, legal and definitional attempts to combat it, and the relationship of antisemitism to other forms of racism and anti-Zionism.",
