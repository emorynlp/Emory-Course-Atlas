And not every British colony would become part of the U.S. So how did ideas about liberty and equality take shape in light of the centrality of dispossession and enslavement to the long process of colonization? How were ideas about race and gender important to understanding these developments? \nThis semester, we will investigate the formation of revolutionary ideas within a broader Atlantic framework in which key events and colonial economies shaped and were shaped by ideas about race, gender, and social status.",
