    "class_notes": "The primary goal of this seminar is to work towards a critical understanding of, and engagement with, how various scholarly publics have emerged around imagining the African past. We will explore the conceptual practices shaping historical production; the ways scholars have framed and reframed questions on and about the past. An important challenge will be to work towards envisioning unexpected questions, unanticipated histories, and new agenda for historical research. A secondary goal of the seminar is to prepare graduate students preparing for field exams and who anticipate researching and teaching about Africa. While focused especially on the past, the seminar is in essence interdisciplinary, though we will have occasion to consider what is meant, and what is left unsaid, by the word \"discipline\".  Works range from anthropology, postcolonial theory, history, and political science.",
