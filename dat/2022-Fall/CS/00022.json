This course covers the main concepts behind the existing technologies in spatial computing and explores future directions where spatial data is driving innovations. The course starts by introducing spatial computing and geometric algorithms to handle spatial data including points, lines, and polygons. Then, the course further covers solutions for indexing, querying, and mining spatial data. Finally, spatial network algorithms and trends and innovations in spatial computing will also be covered.",
