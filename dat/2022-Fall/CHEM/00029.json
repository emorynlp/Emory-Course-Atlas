The course will start with a detailed description of nucleotide conformations, biosynthesis, synthetic modification, and a discussion of functional nucleic acids. We will then focus our attention to protein structure, biosynthesis, synthetic modification, the incorporation of unnatural amino acids, and enzyme kinetics.",
