While the Discovery project must be a scientific inquiry based in Medicine, students are able combine their interests in other areas, such as creative writing, public health, community development, education, or health policy into their project. This is a critical opportunity for students to renew their creative energies and explore a new facet of medicine under the tutelage of an Emory faculty member.",
