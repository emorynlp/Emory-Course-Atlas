It offers a comprehensive overview of the origins, development, and outcomes of National Socialism. It covers the rise of the Nazi party, the establishment of the dictatorship, the emergence of the racial state, the life of Jews and social outsiders in Nazi Germany, the road to war, resistance to the Nazis, daily life in Nazi Germany, gender roles and sexual identity, and the crimes of euthanasia and the Holocaust. This introductory level course is designed for students without any prior knowledge of the subject and will focus on the reading of primary sources (original documents from the time period), combined with lectures and discussion. Assessment is based on active participation and written assignments (primary source analysis, film paper, book essay, take-home final).",
