Emphasizing the ways in which 'sexuality' and 'religion' interacted in the lives of ancient Mediterranean people, the course will investigate (for example) myths about the creating and sustaining of the world through sexual activity, beliefs about sexual unions between human beings and gods and other powerful beings, and ideas about how gods and other powerful beings regulated and judged human sexual desires and behaviors. The course will give special attention to the emergence and development of Judaism and Christianity in the ancient Mediterranean context and to how those internally diverse traditions engaged with questions about sexual desire and behavior.",
