Do the sounds of our environments and communities indicate their health? What place does human-made music have in our world's vast and rich acoustic ecology? Drawing on the fields of ecomusicology and sound studies, in this course we will develop our own responses to these questions and others, through written, audile, and audio-visual texts, and through our own research and creative practices.
