We begin by exploring the immense diversity of Indigenous societies prior to European contact and then shift to the colonial period, examining how Indigenous groups actively shaped and resisted European colonial processes. The final part of the course will focus on some of the legacies of European colonialism, including Indigenous nationalism, slavery, removal, historical memory, genocide, and decolonization. Students will be exposed writings by scholars of Indigenous history (secondary sources) and introduced to material written by Indigenous individuals (primary sources). By the end of the semester, students should be able to answer the following questions: How did Indigenous peoples shape the environmental, political, cultural, and social landscape of the Americas? Why do Indigenous peoples feel that colonization never really ended? How do Indigenous voices tell a different story of the Americas?\nGrading structure: Participation: 20%; Primary source reflections: 10%; Discussion questions: 5%; Hometown/state assignment: 5%; Historicizing genocide assignment: 5%; Decolonization assignment: 5%; Two exams: 20 %; Research project (bibliography: 5%, outline: 10%, final paper: 15%)\nThis course is appropriate for first year students.",
