We will examine narratives or notions that powerful men have created about women as well as those that women have created about themselves or other groups of women. Some of the more expansive categories include the dangerous woman, the virtuous woman, the hysterical woman, etc. \nApproaching our readings from an Atlantic perspective, we will consider the relation of such ideas to beliefs about women's roles and their origins in specific cultures and societies. We will then ask how these beliefs and ideas about women shifted or transformed over time and space. Most importantly, we will examine how narratives about certain groups of women have served larger political, social, cultural, and economic ends in ways that have shaped the trajectory of North American history from the seventeenth century to the end of the eighteenth century. Our readings will focus on the ways in which women of various social, cultural, and racial groups have been portrayed in the writing of North American histories. We will also question what 'women's history' is, how it has been written, and continuing discussions around it.",
