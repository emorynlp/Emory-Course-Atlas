After exploring the roots of violence, this course engages Christian understandings of RJ, and also attends to contemporary work in indigenous religions. Attention will be given to examples of RJ in practice: in criminal justice, in US Christian ministries, in relation to violence and incarceration, and in political engagement of global Christian-based groups and institutions.",
