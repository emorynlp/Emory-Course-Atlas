    "course_description": "A directed study is conducted with permission, under the supervision of a Goizueta faculty member.  The content should represent a line of intellectual inquiry that is aligned with, but falls outside, what is available in the context of the School's elective offerings. A directed study allows the student to pursue an intellectual line of inquiry semi-autonomously, with structured faculty guidance. It replaces an academic course and may carry variable academic hours.The directed study project should contain significant and commensurate content that carries the rigor, time commitment and standards of an elective in the area of study.",
