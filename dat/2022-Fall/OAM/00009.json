Students will learn how to assess a firm and corporate strategy from an analyst's perspective. Accordingly, we explore how firms can create and maintain a strong competitive position across their lines of business -- analyzing competitors across and within their businesses. We then examine how firms enter new businesses through M&A, alliances, and internal development. Finally, we examine strategy analysis and formulation in uncertain and turbulent environments.",
