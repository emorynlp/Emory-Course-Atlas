Topics of focus include sports concussions, the impact of fatigue, scheduling, and psychosocial factors on brain and performance, and effects of practice strategies and exercise per se on the brain. Students will learn some basic neuroscience, explore scientific literature on brain plasticity, and consider implications for best practices for youth sports, training regimens, and regulations and policies in entities such as the NFL. Relative emphasis on specific sports and domains of athletic performance will be determined to a significant degree by the interests of class members.)",
