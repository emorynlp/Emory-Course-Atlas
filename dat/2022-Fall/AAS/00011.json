As the course title suggests, to borrow from poet Dionne Brand, students in this class will explore the idea of \"home\" through the lens of the Caribbean Diaspora by reading short stories, novels, poems, and essays of Caribbean authors living and writing outside of their home space. Texts encountered in this course will focus on themes of diaspora, exile, language, gender and sexuality, family, and self-making. Readings will include works by Jean Rhys, Edwidge Danticat, Dionne Brane, Merle Collins, Tiphanie Yanique, and Nalo Hopkinson, among others.\"Students will develop the skills necessary to write about literature through a series of creative and analytic assignments designed to engage writing in multiple modes.\"",
