Who are the up-and-coming leaders in African American politics, and how are they ascending to national prominence? What is the implication of the ascent of these \\\"\"leaders\\\"\" for the advancement of African American political interests? In this course, students will examine contemporary African American politics to determine whether and how the new generation of African American leaders, (i.e. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Hakeem Jeffries, etc.) promote an African American agenda in a post-Obama environment. Students will apply their knowledge to an in-depth research project which probes the relationship between the leadership styles of individual African American politicians or political groups and the substantive representation that these leaders provide on important policy issues.",
