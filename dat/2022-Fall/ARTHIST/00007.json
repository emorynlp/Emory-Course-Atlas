Special attention will be given to crucial problems like the relation of art to politics; art's response to mass media and technologies, consumer culture, and globalization; and the redefinition of artistic means. More broadly, we will study fundamental tools for examining works of art formally, historically, and critically. The course is not intended as a comprehensive survey of art after 1950; rather, it will address the complex set of aesthetic, philosophical, and political motivations that shaped the artistic production of select figures and movements, including Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Institution Critique, and Performance Art.\nArt History major/minor: Division III",
