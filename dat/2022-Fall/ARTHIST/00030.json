    "class_notes": "\"Classical Antiquity in Miniature: Greek and Roman Gems\"Ancient Greek and Roma gems represent a rich microcosm of classical artistic production. Carved out of semi-precious stones such as sardonyx, amethyst, turquoise and rock crystal, cameos and intaglios depict a diverse array of imagery including mythological figures, animals, fantastic creatures, and portraits. Gems were produced for, collected and worn by a wide range of ancient society from prosperous middle class patrons through Hellenistic monarchs and Roman emperors. The Michael C. Carlos Museum has a very large and significant collection of Greek and Roman gems. The seminar will trace the history, development, iconography, and context of ancient cameos and intaglios through the Carlos gems in close conjunction with the exhibition, \"Making an Impression: The Art and Craft of Ancient Engraved Gemstones\" at the Carlos. Issues of conservation, collecting, and display will also be addressed. Students will work closely with individual gems throughout the semester.",
