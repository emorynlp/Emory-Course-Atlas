Decatur, Room 101.\nThe power to visualize myths, fables, and other sorts of fictional tales; affabulationes in Latin, favole in Italian, visieringhen in Dutch, constitutes one of the key links between poetry and painting.  Anchored in the imaginative faculty, the painter's ability to generate such fictions, to bring them to life in ways plausible and persuasive, served to demonstrate a ready command of poetic invention, as well as familiarity with a range of rhetorical devices, especially the major tropes: simile, metaphor, ekphrasis, allegory, prosopopoeia, syllepsis, metonymy, and synecdoche.  The term fable encompasses a wide range of pictorial types, from Illustrations of Ovid's Metamorphoses to newly coined allegories, sacred and/or profane.  The seminar examines various kinds and degrees of fictional image-making between the mid-fifteenth and mid-seventeenth centuries, focusing on key works by Botticelli, Mantegna, Raphael, Michelangelo, Dürer, Gossart, Floris, Goltzius, Cornelis Corneliszoon, Bloemaert, Rubens, Rembrandt, and Velázquez.",
