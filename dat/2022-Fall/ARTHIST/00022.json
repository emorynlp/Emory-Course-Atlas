We will consider their setting, architecture, and use as places for the display of sculpture and other valuable offerings, as well as the rituals associated with them, including procession, feasting, and performance. In addition to media traditionally associated with elite and civic identity, this course engages with objects and ritual practices that can be used to understand the lives of women, foreigners, and enslaved members of Greek society.\nThe course will involve close reading and discussion of primary evidence (artworks and literature in translation), and introduce students to key archaeological sites in the Greek Aegean and broader Mediterranean world. Secondary literature will introduce students to major anthropological, art historical, and archaeological approaches and current topics of scholarly debate. As part of this course, students will be expected to present on several readings and develop a research paper on a topic of their choosing. \nArt History major/minor: Division I",
