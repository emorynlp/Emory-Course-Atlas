    "class_notes": "Existentialists believe that we define ourselves as we exist. There is no pre-given essence to who we are. Even if our calling were written in the stars, it would still be up to us to take it up. We are radically free to paint the sketch of our lives: to make of it our own work of art.\n \nIn this course, we will investigate the ethical consequences of this view. Can we define ourselves with and through others? Can we form a moral community if we are each radically free to choose our own values? We will review answers to these questions from key existentialist thinkers. Beginning with the `pre-history: of existentialism with Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Fyodor Dostoevsky, we will then move to Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Louis Lavelle.",
    "course_description": "What is Existentialism? We will look at the history of existentialism and see how it challenged the traditional philosophical approaches to questions of human subjectivity and the nature of the good life. In particular, we will explore the works of Jean Paul Sartre and Albert Camus.",
