No one who lives does not also suffer. This insight is the starting point for the Buddha's teachings on the nature of the human condition and the possibility of human flourishing. Although suffering is universal, causes of suffering can be identified. Once identified, these causes can be ameliorated so that the suffering they produce is either less harmful or even eliminated. Humans can learn how to live with suffering and to transform it into something beautiful, just as a gardener uses manure to nourish beautiful flowers. To turn suffering into a path of well-being, however, requires many skills. We need to learn how to look deeply to see the complex causes of suffering. Then we need to learn to see how these causes can be ameliorated or even undone. We also need to train in the methods for ameliorating and undoing the causes of suffering. These methods require work at the personal as well as the communal levels, at the surface as well as the deeper levels of our embodied minds. This course is an introduction to traditional and contemporary Buddhist theories of well-being, happiness, and flourishing, along with some of the methods designed to bring these about.",
