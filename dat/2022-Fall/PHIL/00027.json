Composed of four main modules, this course begins with our normative concepts of nature, starting with the ancient Greeks and Romans, as well as early Chinese and Japanese concepts of nature. We then move to more contemporary approaches via American indigenous views, eco-feminist, and eco-phenomenological, in order offer theories of nature which are better suited to dealing with our current environmental crisis. Major assignments for this course are oriented around the idea of \"public philosophy\" and include several op-eds, a long research paper, and a group podcast.",
