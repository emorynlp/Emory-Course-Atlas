In many cases, their murders were inadequately investigated or prosecuted, their stories left untold, and the crimes against their humanity never punished. The Georgia Civil Rights Cold Cases Project at Emory University is both a class and an ongoing historical and journalistic exploration of the Jim Crow South through the prism of unsolved or unpunished civil rights-era murders in Georgia. Using primary evidence -- including FBI records, NAACP files, old newspaper clippings, court transcripts, and personal archives -- students come to see and understand history from the inside out. Student essays, grounded in secondary readings that provide broader context, will be aimed at the project website, coldcases.emory.edu. Students also may become engaged in the fourth season of a podcast, Buried Truths, based on a case we'll be examining in class. \n \nStudents should budget for photocopying.",
