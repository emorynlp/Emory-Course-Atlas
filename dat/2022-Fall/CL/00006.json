Through a series of chronologically-oriented case studies, we will investigate what it was like for ethnic and religious minorities to live under Greek and then Roman rule.  How did Jews and Christians come to be in the Western Mediterranean?  How did they adapt distinct religious, social, and ethnic identities?  How and why did these groups come into conflict with Greek and Roman populations and governments?  The class will draw on a wide range of sources: literary, epigraphic, papyrological, and archaeological, and will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, group work, and student presentations.",
