This course examines cities and urbanization in the ancient Mediterranean basin: the Near East, Greece, and Rome. Students will learn about sites including Babylon, Pompeii, Athens, Rome, and many others. We will ask what really counts as a city (and if/why that matters); how have and do cities interact with their environments in positive and negative ways; how did people really live in ancient mega-cities like Athens, Alexandria, and Rome; and other questions. No prior knowledge of the history, languages, or cultures, of the Mediterranean is required",
