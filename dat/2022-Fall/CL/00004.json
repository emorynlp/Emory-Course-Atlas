The Parthenon, the Diskobolos, and other works and imitations define modern cityscapes and museums, forming an apparently coherent style that would be challenged, revived, and reinterpreted over the centuries.\n \nYet, the actual history of ancient Greek material culture is a far more complex.  This course provides an in-depth survey of the art, architecture, and broader cultural practices of the ancient Greeks from the Early Iron Age to the rise of Alexander the Great and the creation of the Hellenistic World (1050-323 BCE). We will consider not only the city-states of the Aegean world, but also the traditions of Greek communities from Spain in the west to the Black Sea and Egypt in the east. With a coherent \"Greek\" identity evolving only later in our period of study, we will consider how shared social, artistic, and cultural practices, as evidenced in new archaeological discoveries, allow us to grapple with who the ancient Greeks were.\n \nThe course will consist of lectures, structured discussions of scholarly articles and controversial case studies, and engagement with craft practices. Students will gain hands-on experience working with ancient Greek objects in the Carlos Museum.",
