Although our class discussions and written assignments will be based on our assigned course readings, we may also draw from literature and other cultural forms beyond our assigned readings in order to illustrate these different and sometimes conflicting theoretical approaches.\n\n\nStudents will not only learn about these different approaches to literature and culture and their relationship with one another, but they will also learn how to read theoretical texts and write scholarly papers. This course fulfills one of the five core course requirements for both the Major and Minor Degrees in Comparative Literature as well as the General Education Requirement (GER) in Continuing Writing (WRT) for Emory College.\n\n\nTexts:\nAll assigned readings will be made available in electronic format on Course Reserves.\n\n\nAssessment:\n- 4 response papers (2-3 pp. each, 40% total);\n- Long essay (10-12 pp., 40%);\n- Attendance and participation (20%).",
