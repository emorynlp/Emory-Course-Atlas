Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has suggested the word planetarity to help name such encounters--that is, encounters with an alterity (or otherness) unassimilable both to economic formulas of capitalist globalization and to psychic figures of interiorized subjectivity. In this seminar we will consider how romantic-era prose, poetry, and drama is inextricable from such economic formulas and psychic figures and yet also the site of their coming into crisis--the site where their norms break down. For many of these texts, \"imagination\" stands in a privileged relation to such moments of breakdown. What only seems paradoxical is that the planetary stakes of romanticism emerge from its investment in imagination or what Percy Shelley--channeling Sydney--calls \"the defense of poetry.\" This seeming paradox will inform much of our work, and also serve as a point of departure to address a wide range of issues informing romantic era writing. \n \nTexts: Blake, Wollstonecraft, Equiano, Wordsworth, Coleridge, De Quincey, Byron, Percy Shelley, Keats read in conjunction with more recent critical and theoretical writing.",
