In a highly mediatized environment where the boundaries between spectacle and reality often blur, the tasks of readers and critics are more challenging than ever. This class thus has both theoretical and practical aims. Approaching literature as at once part of human cultural and political life and an effort to reflect critically on the world it represents, we will read a series of classic plays in conversation with the work of significant critics and theorists.",
