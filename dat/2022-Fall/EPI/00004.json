    "course_description": "Pre-requisite: Current enrollment in the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Certificate program at RSPH. Non-certificate students may enroll with permission of the instructor. Infectious disease epidemiology incorporates the fundamental principle that a person's risk of infection often depends on the disease status of another person or the disease prevalence at the population level. Therefore, events are not independent, violating a key assumption of classic epidemiological methods and requiring a different set of methods to approach infectious diseases. This course is a requirement of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Certificate at RSPH. It will provide incoming students an orientation to the breadth of current topics in the field of infectious disease EPI.",
