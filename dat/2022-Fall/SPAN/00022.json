In addition, students will explore the ways in which prescriptive norms affect and differ from the widespread dialectology of the Spanish language.\nSome background in general linguistics, such as the one provided in Span/Ling 303, Span/Ling 304 or Ling 201, is recommended but not required. This course can be used as one of the required 400-level courses for the Joint Major in Spanish & Linguistics or for the Major/Minor in Spanish.\nTEXTS: All readings provided by instructor and available in Canvas\nEVALUATION: Evaluation will be based on class participation & attendance (10%), creative reflections, (40%), quizzes (30%), exploratory learning activities (10%), and a final research presentation (10%)\nPREREQUISITES: One Foundational Course, preferably SPAN/LING 303 or SPAN/LING 304.",
