While psychoanalysis focused initially on sexual traumas, it later addressed the issue of the transgenerational transmission of historical traumas. Why and  how do traumatic histories haunt the next generations? And what happens to those who incarnate past histories that the present prefers to forget?  These are some of the questions that we will address at the juncture of literature and psychoanalysis.\nTexts\n-\tFreud:  Introductory Lectures [selections]\n            Studies in Hysteria [selections]\n            Delusion and Dream in Wilhelm Jensen's Gradiva\n-\tBalzac: Adieu \n-\tMaupassant: The Horla\n-\tApollinaire: Calligrammes: Poems of Peace and War\n-\tDavoine and Gaudilli√®re: History Beyond Trauma [selections]\n-\tGracq: The Opposing Shore",
