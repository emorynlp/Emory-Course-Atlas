To understand why the unconscious is formed and how it works is the task that Freud set for psychoanalytic thought. Such exploration led to a radical rethinking of sexuality and of the very notion of the 'self.' As we shall see, psychoanalysis extends and redefines the notion of 'sexuality' as it traces its impact on mental life. It also unsettles the conception of the self as a unified and monolithic construct to propose instead a dynamic conception of subjectivity as well as complex accounts of its formation. \nReadings may include texts by Freud, Laplanche, Lacan, Dolto, Winnicott, and Pontalis.  Texts will be available either electronically or through PEP archives (which can be accessed via Emory University library).",
