In fall the colloquy is hosted by the faculty of DM715 and DM725 for tracks 1 and 2, respectively; in spring the colloquy is devoted to completion of the final project and initial presentations of the same prior to the Festival of Learning. Students enroll for two hours of credit in the fall semester. They receive an 'IP' (in progress) at the end of the fall semester and will earn an 'S' upon successful completion of the academic year at the end of the spring semester.",
