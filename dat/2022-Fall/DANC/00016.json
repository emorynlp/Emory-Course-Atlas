Studying choreographic elements and devices, as well as identifying the objectives of key dance makers, students will discover the breadth of contemporary western concert dance. Finally, students will analyze the cultural, social, and political significance of particularly meaningful and/or consequential dance works thorough viewings and academic readings. Please note this is not a movement class.",
    "course_description": "This course will provide a framework for observing, analyzing, notating, and understanding movement as an expressive, communicative form. Movement literacy skills are demonstrated through the body by building relationships between Body, Space, Shape, and Effort. By utilizing Rudolph Laban's Movement Analysis system (LMA), emphasis is placed on embodying movement intention and discovering context and meaning in stylistic patterns of movement. Required course for dance and movement studies majors.",
