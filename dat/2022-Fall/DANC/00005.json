Students will create, perform, produce, examine, and begin to define their own aesthetics by taking in as much art and culture as one can in a semester! Guest lectures, abstract thinking, and a journey into unfamiliar arts-driven territory will define the class. Students will have the opportunity to gain some hands-on experience with different artistic genres, including music, theater, visual arts, and dance.",
