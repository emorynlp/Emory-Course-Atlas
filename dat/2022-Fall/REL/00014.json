Tocqueville highlighted that American preachers were constantly \"referring to the earth,\" so much so that it was difficult to ascertain whether the \"principle object of religion is to obtain eternal felicity\" or to foster trust in the divine provisioning of \"prosperity in this world.\"This course will focus on the ways that religion has shaped, and been shaped by, the \"earthly matters\" of American capitalism.  Some of the questions we'll consider are: What is American capitalism? What are the relationships between various American religious traditions and the political economy of the United States?  To what extent is religion a part of the cultural foundations of the market? How has religion been brought to bear on questions of economic organization, the accumulation of wealth, and the growth of a consumer society?  And how might the analytical categories of race, class, and gender be deployed to better understand the historical trajectories of both American religious traditions and the American economy?",
