This seminar focuses on the readings of Job by nineteenth century \"existentialist\" writers, Soren Kierkegaard and Fyodor Dostoevsky. In Repetition, Kierkegaard's protagonist uses the example of Job's ordeal and legendary patience as an intensely personal lens through which to view his broken engagement. In Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, Ivan Karamazov's denunciation of God's world is modeled on the impatient, rebel Job, while the holy elder Zossima bases his life-philosophy on Job the patient.",
