    "class_notes": "How do we talk about religion? The oldest distinction is probably true/false (or us/them); we can also speak of religion as positive and negative, liberating and oppressive; sociologically, psychologically, ethically; as text, as performance, as identity, as well as in terms of traditions (Buddhism, Christianity, etc.) and regions (Asia, America, etc.) and themes (death, sexuality, etc.) But how do you want to speak of religion? What audiences do you want to reach? This class is designed to explore and expand the possibilities of your own voice(s). We address the history and politics of the concept of \"religion;\" we ask if it is possible to speak \"scientifically\" about religion; we ask how to speak responsibly about religion and violence; and explore issues related to cultural appropriation.",
