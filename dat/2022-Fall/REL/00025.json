It meets for two synchronous 75-minute sessions per week on MW.\nThis course satisfies the new Religion major requirement:- Tradition-Christianity, Theme. \nDeath is a central category in the history of religions. It is, more importantly, one of the few constants throughout human history. Because of its reality in our own lives and the world around us, it would seem to be an important subject to discuss. But how should we discuss it? Like sexuality, aging, and drugs, death is a universal aspect of human life, experience, and embodiment. It is universal because it is necessary for the life of the individual physical body and because it is essential to the formation and unity of the social body. The course will explore death and religious cultures around the globe and through time, though much of our focus will be on death and religious life in the US.",
