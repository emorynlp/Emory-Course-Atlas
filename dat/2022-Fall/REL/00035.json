Here selfhood is not cognitive, but a lived experience. Augustine's existential perspective comes to the fore in Book X, where, having established the absolute reality of inner experience, Augustine expects from God is an answer to the question, \"Who am I?\"A second prominent instance of \"becoming a question to oneself\" occurs in Book IV, in Augustine's confession of grief following the death of his friend. Here the ethical and political consequences of Augustine's understanding of the order of love with regard to God and the neighbor become legible. This seminar juxtaposes Augustine's introspective philosophy with 20th century philosophies about what it means to be a self and what it means to be a self in relation to the other by Heidegger, Arendt and Levinas. How does \"becoming a question to oneself\" become, under pressure from the other, a putting into question of the self?",
