Tied, in its own self-understanding, to a particular people in a small corner of the world, it nevertheless developed profound religious ideas and literature that affected peoples and faiths around the globe.  Over its millennia, Judaism has produced law and lore, philosophers and mystics whose ideas carried Jews through centuries of wandering and persecution.  In this course we will examine the gripping story of how Judaism's religious practice, sacred texts and inspired ideas evolved from its ancient beginnings to the present day, with special focus on America and Israel.",
