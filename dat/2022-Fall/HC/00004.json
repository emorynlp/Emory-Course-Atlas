    "course_description": "This course is a seminar on the history of women, gender, and religion in America. We will primarily draw on historical and social scientific methods of investigation and proceed thematically as we ask several related questions. How have religious communities in America shaped understandings of gender and sexuality? How have individuals used religious beliefs, texts, and practices to defend or criticize gender norms? Given that women have historically dominated membership rolls but not pulpits in America, what happened when women began to preach and teach?",
