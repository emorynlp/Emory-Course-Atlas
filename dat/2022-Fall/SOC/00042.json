An understanding of Korean cultural norms and practices is incomplete without understanding how they are embedded and performed in daily life of ordinary Korean families. Family is the most fundamental institution in Korean society in regards to socialization of their children through child rearing practices, schooling and education.  In the beginning of the course, the lectures and readings will focus on comprehensive understanding of families as an emotional unit and its complex interactions through Bowen's family systems as well as the lifespan perspectives on human development from birth to the end of life. Then the class moves on to culture-specific Korean families' issues and topics including family values and filial piety, traditional views of women and mothering, changes in child rearing practices, socialization of children, work-family conflict and balance, familism in relation to gender, disability and diversity, intergenerational relationships, nationwide family policy on low-birth rate, and family caregiving and aging.",
