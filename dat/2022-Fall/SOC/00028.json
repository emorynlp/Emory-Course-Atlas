You will need permission to register and must have 446W as prerequisite. It aims to bring to a co-authored journal submission the work carried out by students in 446W on different text corpora. The course is an intensive 4-credits analytic and writing course that fulfills the writing requirement. As a result of the W, we need to make sure to carry out, even if in small teams, a great deal of bi-weekly writing.\nStudents will work in teams, one team per corpus. Teams will be expected to present their work, as a team, every two weeks throughout the semester and present four co-authored drafts of their ongoing work at regular intervals. We should all read and comment each other's drafts.\nFinal paper and literature review\nSince the final paper is expected to be submitted to a journal, the literature review part of the paper will engage both appropriate NLP literature and specific topic literature as appropriate for the corpus (thus, a corpus of country folktales will need to address the literature on folktales).\nThe projects\nStudents' teams have been working on following corpora.\n1.\tCross-national folktales\n2.\tNew York Times book reviews\n3.\tPOTUS speeches\n4.\tHarry Potter books\n5.\tHIV personal narratives from Africa\n6.\tGay men personal narratives\n7.\tCorpus collected by a team",
