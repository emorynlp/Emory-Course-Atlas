Our focus will be on understanding how, why, and to what effects, collaborative, community-based, cross-sector (public-private-nonprofit) initiatives are crafted. The course addresses several tensions and issues that affect the practice of community building, and the processes through which community builders attempt to overcome these obstacles to foster social change comprehensively (e.g., reduce poverty and promote economic mobility) as well as within specific policy domains such as education, economic development, workforce development, health, and the environment, among others. We will explore the course material through lectures, individual and group exercises, and the examination of a variety of case studies of comprehensive community initiatives launched over the past 30 years. This course is a requirement for participation in Emory's Community Building and Social Change Fellows Program, though students do not need to commit to participating in the CBSC program to enroll. For more information on the CBSC program see https://www.emorycbsc.com/ or contact the CBSC program director, Kate Grace, at kdgrace@emory.edu.",
