    "class_notes": "(Same as ANT 385W 1)\nIn this era of both climate change and high mass consumption, our world faces enormous challenges to our systems of producing, consuming, distributing, and transitioning energy. While we often think of these challenges as technological, they are bound up in questions of culture, racial inequality, economic order, political power, social organization, and ethics. This course draws upon historical, anthropological, and literary sources to examine the infrastructures 'the constructed networks of ideas, technologies, people, and goods' that constitute energy systems. We will consider how energy both constitutes and bears upon our social worlds, our physical well-being, our economic and political relations, and our everyday lives.",
