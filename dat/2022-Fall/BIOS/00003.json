We then focus on multilevel modeling of intra- and inter-individual change. Other hierarchical models will also be examined to analyze other types of clustered data. As in the prerequisite courses, we will learn how to specify an appropriate model so that specific research questions of interest can be addressed in a methodologically sound way. Students will use SAS to perform the statistical analyses.",
