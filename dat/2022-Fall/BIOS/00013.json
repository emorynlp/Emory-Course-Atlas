This course introduces students to modern regression techniques commonly used in analyzing public health data. Specific topics include: (1) parametric and non-parametric methods for modeling non-linear relationships (e.g., splines and generalized additive models); (2) methods for modeling longitudinal and multi-level data that account for within group correlation (e.g., mixed-effect models, generalized estimating equations); (3) Bayesian methods; and (4) shrinkage methods and bias-variance tradeoffs. \nThis course draws motivating examples from environmental and social epidemiology, health services research, clinical studies, and behavioral sciences. The course provides a survey of advanced regression approaches with a focus on data analysis and interpretation. Students will gain an understanding of methods that will facilitate future independent and collaborative research for modern research problems. Students will gain practical experience using the R language for statistical computing. \"",
