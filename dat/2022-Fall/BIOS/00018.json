This course covers the basics of microarray and second-generation sequencing data analysis using R/BioConductor and other open source software. Topics include gene expression microarray, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and general DNA sequence analyses. We will introduce technologies, data characteristics, statistical challenges, existing methods and potential research topics. Students will also learn to use proper Bioconductor packages and other open source software to analyze different types of data and deliver biologically interpretable results.",
