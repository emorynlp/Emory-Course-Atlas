    "class_notes": "This is a discussion-based course surveying plays produced in the American Theater 'now' by playwrights who identify as both Asian and Asian-American. We will read plays, compose short essays, complete a research-based paper,  and compose creative projects in the context of Asian and Asian American history and drama. Some key questions this course will engage in are: Historically, how have Asian Americans been represented on American stages? What known and lesser-known historical contexts have created Asian American stereotypes and lead to the marginalization of Asian American narratives in the dramatic cannon? How are playwrights of today redefining or subverting drama and identity and what does \"Asian American Identity\" actually mean?",
