    "class_notes": "What makes a word a word, as opposed to a phrase or sentence? What are the basic principles that determine how words, phrases and sentences are formed cross-linguistically? We will cover some well-known concepts in syntactic theory: including constituency, category, dependent clauses, argument structure, anaphora, wh-questions and other kinds of displacement, and see how they are analyzed in a generative grammar framework. We will periodically face the question `How are words different from sentences?' and in the second part of the course we will examine this question in-depth by looking at some problematic cases in English and other languages. Students will develop the vocabulary and problem-solving techniques that linguists use for morphosyntactic analysis: recognizing patterns in linguistic data, testing hypotheses, applying diagnostic tools, and advancing arguments and counterarguments.\n\n\nRequired Textbook(s): All assigned readings will be online.\n\n\nPrerequisite: Foundations of Linguistics (LING 201, LING_OX 201 or ANT 203), or equivalent course with permission of instructor.",
