    "course_description": "This course provides an introduction/overview to the various components of the U.S. healthcare system. It examines the multiple determinants of health (focusing on the role that medical care plays), private and public financing mechanisms for medical care, various healthcare providers, and the effects of both market competition and government regulation. One objective of the course is for students to gain institutional knowledge of the U.S. healthcare system that is relevant to both healthcare managers and policy analysts. A second objective of the course is for students to learn to critically examine the tradeoffs associated with various health policies. These tradeoffs fundamentally result from a lack of resources to fund all desired medical care. As such, we will examine how collective interests shape the design of health policies.",
