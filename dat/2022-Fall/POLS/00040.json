We will begin with Aristophanes: 'Clouds' and Plato's 'Apology of Socrates.' We will then turn to a detailed examination of a series a shorter Platonic dialogues with a view to determining Socrates: guilt or innocence. This is a research course, so we will work together on developing 1) the art of close reading and interpretation, and 2) the art of writing a clear, well structured, and convincing paper. Some background in political philosophy is recommended, but not required.",
