Emphasis will be placed on applying theories of electoral institutions and behavior to polling data and election results in real time, as would be the case in a data journalism or public-facing scholarship context. Students will learn to use the programming language R to conduct their own novel analyses, with scheduled instructional time split between demonstration sessions led by the instructor and self-directed lab time. For Fall 2022, the course will focus on analyzing election data from concurrent Georgia elections. Student collaboration and the production of public-facing research will be key goals of the course. Undergraduates should enroll in POLS 494, Graduate students in POLS 585.",
