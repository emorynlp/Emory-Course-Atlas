Course instructors will provide introductory lessons on basic coding in Python, which will be used throughout the course through collaborative, group-based lab tutorials.  The focus of this course will be to use these in-lab tutorials to understand how neuroscience data is structured, analyzed, simulated, and interpreted.\nThe course will be divided into 2 portions: (1) coding, running, and interpreting simulations of neural activity, and (2) understanding the analysis of neural data.  The course consists of lectures, group lab tutorials, and individual homework assignments for each module.  This course originates in the Biology Department, and it will count as an elective and upper-level laboratory credit for the Biology major.  (This course does NOT COUNT as elective credit for the NBB major; the catalog description is incorrect.)\nPrerequisites:  Biology 142/142L and Chemistry 202; pre- or co-requisite:  Biology 360/NBB 301).",
    "course_description": "This course will explore topics in cellular and small network neuroscience by performing virtual electrophysiology experiments on the computer.
