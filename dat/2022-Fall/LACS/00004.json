Class discussions will engage readings, film, and music to inquire about matters of sex, sexuality, embodiment, race, flesh, and relationality as they happen in relation to Latinx religions.  Rather than studying religious traditions such as Catholicism, Protestantism, Pentecostalism, Judaism, or Islam, and how Latinx people are subjects attached to those major traditions, this seminar invites students to interrogate these religions and to see the ways in which religion envelopes and, more often than not, renders brown gendered bodies opaque, weak, or invisible.  Ultimately, the course will ask students to see how Latinx peoples engage religions inside and out of institutional spaces to mobilize sex, sexuality, race, flesh, and relationality in various systems of belief.",
