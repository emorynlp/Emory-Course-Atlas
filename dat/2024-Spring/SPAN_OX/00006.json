With a strong emphasis on oral language skills, this course explores first-hand the diverse and vibrant Spanish-speaking communities within the region that hail from all corners of the Spanish-speaking world. Students will engage with a broad spectrum of speakers, including local artists, small business owners, healthcare workers, and animal rights activists to gain valuable insights into their experiences and unique perspectives. These conversations will promote interactional diversity and experiential pedagogy and thus require active participation from all enrolled. The required 50-minute weekly meetings will alternate between conversations with community members and student reflections. Some course activities include brief reading and writing assignments, but, in general, the emphasis will be on oral communication. \nPREREQUISITE: Spanish 212 or an Official Spanish Placement for a Foundational Spanish Course.
