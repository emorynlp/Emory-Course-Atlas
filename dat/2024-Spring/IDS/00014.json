What makes us coil in horror and disgust? What kind of limitations do we establish when we turn away from that which disturbs us? These are some guiding questions as we turn to philosophical topics of `filth' in terms of the psyche, sex, race, conspiracies, etc. while extending these theoretical explorations into the realm of science and our relationships to it. This course will further cover the basics of how to conduct research in biological sciences in order to expose students to the mechanisms of scientific development and how to approach and draw conclusions from scientific literature. The philosophical and the scientific will come together in applying the theoretical explorations of the abject in analyses of the science to which our immediate reaction is - GROSS!",
