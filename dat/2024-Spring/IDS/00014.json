    "class_notes": "Over the course of the last century (even the last decade!) social and technological changes have radically reshaped our attitudes toward friendship, renewing our attention not only to its value and complexity, but also to the proliferating ways that friendships can be formed, mediated, strengthened, or undermined. In this class, we will explore friendship by thinking about its relationship to artistic creation, investigating friendship as it helps, hinders, and itself constitutes a form of art. We will read literary texts and films that explore both real and imagined friendships, bringing them into conversation with essays from philosophy, anthropology, and gender and sexuality studies to ask: what distinguishes friendship from other relationships, and how are these distinctions complicated by crossing racial and gendered lines? How have representations of friendship changed with changing understandings of romance and family? Are friendship's attachments based in likeness, or difference? When is friendship erotic - never, sometimes, always? What are the obligations and ethics of friendship? Most importantly, we will explore friendship at its limits: what are the lines - social, emotional, and aesthetic - that friendship can and cannot cross? Possible readings include fiction and poetry by Virginia Woolf, Frank O'Hara, Nella Larsen, Toni Morrison, and Jane Austen, films like Y Tu Mama Tambien and The Odd Couple, and essays by Montaigne, Aristotle, and Emerson.",
