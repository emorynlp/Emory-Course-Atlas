    "class_notes": "\"In a typical college schedule filled with mandatory assignments, reading for pleasure-diving into another world simply for the joy of it-can fall by the wayside. This course helps you to carve out time for literary fiction picked by your peers. Our three undergraduate TA's will each choose a book for the class to read and will lead a class discussion on that book.  \nThe first class will be held on January 26, and we will meet for a total of 10 Fridays over the course of the semester. Our class format will vary; in addition to the three sessions devoted to group discussion of the books we're reading, we'll have sessions in which students and faculty briefly present favorite books, while others will entail more creative endeavors, such as a bookmaking workshop, a visit to the Rose Library's collection of handmade books, or a book or poetry reading. For the last class of the semester, we will celebrate our love of the literary-and the ways it enhances our connection to others and ourselves-over dinner together.\"",
