    "class_notes": "Topic:  Green Gentrification and the Atlanta Beltline\nThe Atlanta Beltline has been embraced by many across the metro Atlanta region and across the country as a positive symbol of urban redevelopment and revitalization. However, in recent years, the Beltline and its effects on the City of Atlanta and the region have sparked discussions and debates around gentrification, displacement, and equity. Urban green spaces, pedestrian-friendliness, and density make cities happier and healthier, but who actually benefits from these privileges? Who gets to stay? Who has to leave? This course offers students the chance to think critically about sustainable development and displacement using the Beltline as a relevant, important, and unique case study. In addition to discussions on green gentrification and new urbanism in Atlanta and across the country, this course will include site visits to key areas along and around the Beltline.",
