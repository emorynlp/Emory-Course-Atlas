    "class_notes": "Medical residents speak of the \"hidden curriculum\" of medical school-beyond the physiological and therapeutic knowledge they learn, they also learn how the medical system works-how little time for human connection, compassion, and meaning overworked doctors share with their patients. Think of this sidecar as the antidote to that hidden curriculum. Poetry, literature, art cultivate a profound encounter with another individual human being in ways that show the importance of community, sharing, love, and vulnerability. \nSessions will mostly take place at Grady, though we are exploring the possibility of one or two sessions at Emory College.\nFridays (Jan. 26, Feb. 23, March 22, April 5, and April 19), 1:30-4:00 pm",
