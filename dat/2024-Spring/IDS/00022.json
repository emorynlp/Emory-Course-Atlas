Many cultures, from Byzantium to China, employed castrated men within their courts. There, they were crucial not only to the care of the ruling family, but also to the creation and maintenance of an elite aesthetic. Framed as an exercise in seeing from a traditionally marginalized historical perspective, this seminar will balance close-looking and historical investigation with more theoretical texts on gender, performance, and political power. Topics will range from the Assyrian court to the tomb of the Prophet Muhammed, to the enigmatic lost voice of the castrato. We will view objects in the Carlos Museum and listen for the extinct voice of the castrato lingering in the voices of modern opera singers. Course assignments will explore how close looking, close reading, and a consideration of performative records allow us to access knowledge about marginalized figures and their historical import.",
