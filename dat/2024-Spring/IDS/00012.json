    "class_notes": "The course will investigate early history and origins of medicine primarily in Greece and Rome with some special attention to Mediterranean and Early Eastern medical culture. The focus on the course will be to foster critical thinking and analysis skills via primary texts and through discussion. We hope to acknowledge the spectacular achievements as well as the curiously unfounded theories concerning medicine across past millenia. The complexities of the human body and ways we have come to diagnose and treat conditions will become less of a mystery as we progress through the growth of practices.",
