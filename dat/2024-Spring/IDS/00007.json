It occupies a liminal space between deliberate action, established habit, and unplanned spontaneity. However, the act of improvisation extends far beyond the arts. In this course, we invite you to explore how embracing improvisation can improve your professional and personal life by enhancing your creativity and adaptability. We will participate in various group improvisational activities across disciplines and invite guest speakers from different fields, including medicine, sports, and science, to speak about using improvisation in their workplace.",
