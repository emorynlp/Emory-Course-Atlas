    "class_notes": "(Same as ENG 385W 2)\nWhat does global poetry right now--where \"right now\" can mean the twenty-first century, the past year, or even the last twenty-four hours--look like, particularly if we situate poets of color not along the margins but right at the center? What assumptions and questions do we bring to bear when we read Black poets, Latinx poets, Asian and Asian diasporic poets, Pacific Islander poets, Indigenous poets, and mixed-race poets? (For that matter: What do we bring to bear when we read a white or \"unmarked\" poet?) Questions like these will guide our careful reading of ten or so poetry books from around the English-speaking world, all published in the past decade. We'll also study the many media where poetry is now published, reviewed, and adapted, from magazines and anthologies to social media and web series. Besides short creative and critical assignments, we'll read and reverse-engineer the primary prose genre of poetry criticism today, the book review, and write and workshop our own efforts. Our writing culminates in a research paper, equal in scope and ambition to a publishable review-essay or academic article. Producing what is likely the most extensive writing on our poets of choice, we will uncover ways of thinking sensitively and resourcefully about poetry right now, or invent those ways ourselves.",
