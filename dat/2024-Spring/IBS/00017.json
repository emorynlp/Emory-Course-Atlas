    "course_description": "The health effects of environmental or pharmaceutical chemicals depend on their concentrations and their metabolites in the human body. Given an exposure to a chemical, understanding and predicting its internal concentrations can be greatly aided by a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) or pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approach. PBTK/PBPK models simulate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination processes that collectively determine the fates of exogenous chemicals in the human body, producing as model output temporal changes in chemical tissue concentrations.",
