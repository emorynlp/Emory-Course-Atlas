This course focuses on the mechanisms and phenomenology of sleep and dreams as a basis for discussing their implications for behavior, cognition, emotion, evolution, and related philosophical issues. General topics include circadian rhythms and sleep, the biological basis of sleep and dreaming, the role of sleep in memory and other cognitive phenomena, relationships between sleep, mood, and other drives and conditions, individual, cultural and species differences in sleep behavior, lucid dreaming and other subjective components of sleep, sleep and drugs, sleep disorders, and sleep as a model for studying states of consciousness. \nWhile there will be some lecture for background, the emphasis is on student participation in discussion, class activities, and sharing of ideas. In addition to covering some of the key science of sleep and dreams, goals are to enhance students' ability to evaluate, integrate and apply information within a complex area of human experience and behavior and become more thoughtful consumers of related information in the popular press and cyberspace.\nParticulars: Intended mainly for junior and senior Psychology and NBB majors. Readings include book chapters, journal articles, and online media.  Grading is based on class participation, several short response papers and weekly postings, sleep log and dream journal assignments, one individual presentation, and a final project.",
