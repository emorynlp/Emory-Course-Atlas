We also will review molecular genetic methods for finding specific genes that underlie behavior. We will begin by reviewing the historical backdrop to behavior genetics, including a focus on Charles Darwin, Francis Galton, and Gregor Mendel. We will proceed to examine the use of twin and adoption studies to disentangle genetic and environmental influences, and the advantages of these methods over family studies. We will then review various molecular genetic methods for finding specific genes. We will end by exploring the results of quantitative and molecular genetic studies of various forms of psychopathology, personality, and behavior.
