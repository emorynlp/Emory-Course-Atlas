Students will read foundational literature and experimental studies that use both behavioral methods and brain imaging techniques.  Topics covered will include the perception and processing of spoken and signed speech, the linguistic encoding of perceived objects and events, the relationship between mental concepts and linguistic labels, neural mechanisms of language learning, and processes of reading and writing.  We will also investigate language in the brain by looking at atypical populations (such as those with autism, dyslexia, and aphasia) and non-humans (such as primates, birds, and artificial intelligence).\n(Same as LING 309 1)",
