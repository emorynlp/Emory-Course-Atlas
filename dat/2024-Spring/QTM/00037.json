    "class_notes": "When we teach statistics, we often act as if simple models were right. For example, we might find the line that best fits the data, then act as if that line were a useful description of reality. With the right blend of intuition and luck, this can work --- we can get by with a model that is wrong but not too wrong --- but it's often helpful to have a more nuanced perspective. This class is an introduction to the theory and practice of doing statistics without simplistic modeling assumptions. In short, we will talk about how to answer questions about the world, like whether a treatment helps patients or a policy has the intended effect, by fitting flexible models to data.",
    "course_description": "This class is a special topics course in quantitative theory and methods. The topic may vary from semester to semester, but all projects will be data-driven with well-defined deliverables. Students will engage with datasets in a collaborative environment and ultimately produce both a project report and oral presentation. The course will specifically serve QTM students by offering preparation for their culminating capstone research experience.",
