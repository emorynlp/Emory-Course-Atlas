    "class_notes": "When we teach statistics, we often act as if simple models were right. For example, we might find the line that best fits the data, then act as if that line were a useful description of reality. With the right blend of intuition and luck, this can work --- we can get by with a model that is wrong but not too wrong --- but it's often helpful to have a more nuanced perspective. This class is an introduction to the theory and practice of doing statistics without simplistic modeling assumptions. In short, we will talk about how to answer questions about the world, like whether a treatment helps patients or a policy has the intended effect, by fitting flexible models to data.\n\n\nPrerequisite QTM 220 or equivalent.
