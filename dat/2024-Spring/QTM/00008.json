In this first year seminar, we build an understanding of how to use data to make insights about our world. We do this through a series of case studies, each focusing on a different social science topic and a different data science skill set. Our case studies include exercises from anthropology, human biology, sociology, economics, global health and demography and more. Through these cases, we will learn (and practice) a tool kit of computational skills and analytical thinking that includes data visualization, inferential thinking, basic statistical analyses, and text mining, and web scraping. By the end of the seminar, you will have made studied many interesting aspects of your world and learned some valuable computational skills. No programming experience is required!",
