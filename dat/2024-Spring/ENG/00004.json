This course focuses on her fiction, especially her novels Tracks, The Round House, and The Night Watchman, along with her children's novel The Birchbark House. We will also engage some of Erdrich's poetry and non-fiction prose, interviews with her, and scholarship about her work. Erdrich depicts Indigenous people's experiences with boarding schools, sexual violence, land theft, anti-colonial resistance, Indigenous feminisms, and Anishinaabe teachings. We will discuss these topics and consider how Erdrich's craft contributes to her portrayal. We will also explore the impact of Erdrich's work for law, politics, pop culture, and education.",
