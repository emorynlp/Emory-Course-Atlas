    "class_notes": "When Coleridge wrote that poetry is the best words in the best order, he failed to add that such words and orders always occur in a line, a column of air pushed out of a human body. This course aims to redress that inadvertent slip in a chronological survey of lineation and verse-form strategies deployed over a thousand years. We will study lines in narratives, songs set to music, romances, riddles, dream poems, plays, lyric poems, epigraphs, epitaphs, and more. We will take up a dazzling array of complete poems and passages, including, Caedmon's Hymn, Beowulf, the Rhyming Poem, ballad stanzas, Chaucer's Rhyme Royal in Troilus and Criseyde, Sir Gawain and The Green Knight, the Fourteener, Skeltonics, The Faerie Queene, iambic lyrics, Marlowe's mighty line, (Shakespeare's, too), even Paradise Lost, observing, inferring from, analyzing, and bearing witness to how the line-making is the Ur-site and sine qua non of poesis. Students will draft, revise, polish, and present at the end of the term an Abecedary, twenty-six brief meditations on this history of the line and its implications.",
