    "class_notes": "Topic: \"Odbhuth\" India: Queer Vernaculars of Indian Literature\n?????? | odbhuth\n(Bangla) strange, peculiar, queer\nWhen a queer artists' collective in Kolkata was founded in the 2010s, it borrowed its name from a Bangla lyric by Rabindranath Tagore (\"amra odbhuth,\" or, \"we are peculiar\") rather than the English \"queer,\" to name the collective it served. Like the Amra Odbhuth Collective, many communities, corporations, artistic and scholarly practices around the world are tapping into indigenous registers and vernaculars of \"alternative\" genders and sexualities to shape new vocabularies for queer identities. \"Queer\" comes out of the Global North and has a widely taxonomic and political purchase today, prominently as a shorthand for the LGBTQIA+. Before its appropriation as a slur, and its reclamation by those who sustained its injury, \"queer,\" like the Bangla \"odbhuth\" implied the strange and peculiar, sometimes the unknown or misfit. So, how portable is \"queer\" to the Global South?\n\n\nThis course will attempt to respond to this query by using India and its \"odbhuth\" literature as a case study. In this course, students will engage with short stories in translation, children's literature, poetry, a graphic novel, a play, and the archives of Trikone recently acquired by the Rose Library. Lectures offering historical scaffolding and articles on current scholarly debates in queer studies will supplement interpretations of primary texts. In this course, we will query the tensions that arise when taxonomies of the Global North, like \"queer,\" become a part of non-heteronormative spaces in the Global South. Can a complete decolonisation from such \"imported\" taxonomies be possible? Or are there some benefits to the syncretism that arises when two worlds, and the two ways of accenting queerness, collide? To answer some of these questions, students will produce weekly discussion posts, a \"keyword\" entry, and a final project that culminates as a multimedia essay. \nProspective students are encouraged to email the instructor with questions on course expectations, the tentative syllabus, and potential assignments for this course.",
