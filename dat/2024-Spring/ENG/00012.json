This \"middle\" period bridged biblical, classical, Germanic and Celtic traditions to our modern ideas of what the English language is and who the English people are, both in space and time.  English speakers come in many varieties, linguistically and ethnically.  We will read a selection of Middle English lyrics, drama, narrative poetry, and prose, including the following sub-genres: alliterative long line (Brut); dream vision (Pearl and Piers Plowman); Romance (Sir Orfeo); fabliau (Dame Sirith); Arthurian history (Malory's Morte Darthur).",
