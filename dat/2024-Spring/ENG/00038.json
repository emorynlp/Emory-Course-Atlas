    "class_notes": "In her essay \"How Should One Read a Book?\"  Virginia Woolf suggests that the best way to experience fiction is to drop all preconceived notions of what a novel can be: \"do not dictate to your author; try to become him. Be his fellow-worker and his accomplice.\" In this course we will become the accomplices of one of the most inventive and distinctive writers of twentieth-century literature as we investigate the range and depth of Woolf's impact on the form of the novel itself. Reading our way through much of Woolf's major fiction as well as a selection of her essays, stories, and autobiographical writing, we will think about Woolf as a critic, humorist, feminist, and literary innovator, with special consideration to the way Woolf reinvents traditional representations of character and human consciousness.  \nWhile Woolf is most famous for illuminating the interior self, she was also a writer deeply attuned to the world around her. Discussing her writing will therefore also provide us with a distinctive view of the culture of the modernist era, from the adventurous artistic and philosophical spirit of Bloomsbury to the major transformations affecting England in the first half of the twentieth century: world war and its aftermath, changing social and sexual mores, new conceptions of gender roles and women's rights, advances in human psychology, and contemporaneous developments in painting and design.\n\n\nTexts may include some of the following: Woolf, Night and Day, Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando, Between the Acts; A Room of One's Own; Forster, Maurice; Bowen, The House in Paris; Mansfield, stories; Watson, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day. Expectations: regular attendance and lively participation; weekly short Canvas postings; midterm and final essays.",
