    "class_notes": "Topic: Indigenous Literatures from Turtle Island\nThis course examines contemporary fiction, poetry, essay, and theories written and produced by Native American authors in what is now the continental U.S. Through our critical readings, we will not only explore literary forms, techniques, and major themes, but also historical and cultural contexts that will offer a nuanced outlook of what being Indigenous means today. Some of the topics our critical readings and discussions will address include racial/ethnic and gender oppression, reservation life, acculturation, political and social resurgence. We will read the works of, among other authors, Leslie Marmon Silko, Eddie Chuculate, Joy Harjo, and Vine Deloria Jr. Our critical readings will also allow us to engage with diverse critical approaches to Native American literature. These include Robert Warrior's \"American Indian Intellectual Sovereignty,\" Craig Womack's \"American Indian Literary Nationalism,\" Daniel Heath Justice's \"Why Indigenous Literatures Matter'', and Melanie Benson Taylor's, \"Native American Literature Does Not Exist.\"\n\n\nRequired texts:\n-Eddie Chuculate's Cheyenne Madonna\n-Vine Deloria Jr. Custer Died for Your Sins\n-Joy Harjo's An American Sunrise \n-Leslie Marmon Silko, Ceremony",
