Some of these plays, such as Pulitzer-Prize winning Fat Ham (which will be at the Alliance this Spring), draw from classic texts (Hamlet in this case). Others, possibly including those from EmoryÂ¿s Brave New Works Festival this Spring, present new stories and perspectives on contemporary issues.  Students will have the opportunity to explore authors from diverse backgrounds and will be encouraged to consider how theatrical repertoire have shifted since the pandemic.",
