How do African writers and filmmakers imagine cultural, economic, political, and sexual independence? In what ways do their texts enact forms of independence and interdependence? To what extent does African literature itself rely on publishers and prizes based outside the continent? While our focus will be on English-language fiction, we will also examine essays and poetry in English, as well as cinema involving Arabic, French, Wolof, and Kiswahili.",
