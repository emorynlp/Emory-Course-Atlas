Beginning with Yeats, we will examine this relationship between conflict and creativity in Irish writing and end the semester with Seamus Heaney and the so-called Troubles in Northern Ireland. Focusing on the Irish literary collections held in the Rose Library, students will discuss the relationship between art and violence, poetry and politics, memory and commemoration. Expect frequent writing posts, two papers, presentations, and a final project. Students are required to attend at least 1 lecture, performance, or poetry reading by visiting speakers outside class.",
