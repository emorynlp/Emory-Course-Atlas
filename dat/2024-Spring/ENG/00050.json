In this context, we will explore some of the terms in which memory is talked about, including the distinctions between public, collective, social or cultural, memory, on the one hand, and private, personal, or autobiographical, memory, on the other hand. We will consider the political, ethical, social, aesthetic, and psychological dimensions of remembering \"and its counterpart, forgetting\" and consider some of the ways in which perspectives and approaches from the field of Memory Studies might offer useful analytical and hermeneutic tools for our work.\nWeekly responses to the readings and a semester project.",
