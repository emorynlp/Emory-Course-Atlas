    "class_notes": "This course offers a wide-ranging survey of more than 300 years of British literature. As we move through the centuries, we will study the distinctive literary innovations and achievements of the major periods of British literary history, after 1660: specifically, the Restoration, the Eighteenth Century (i.e., the Enlightenment), Romanticism, the Victorian age, and the Twentieth Century (i.e., Modernism and Postmodernism). Although many aesthetic, philosophical, and historical issues will demand our careful attention, our main task will be to trace the relationships among literature, society, and politics, focusing especially on how notions of authority, tradition, freedom, and self-expression are represented through a variety of literary texts.",
