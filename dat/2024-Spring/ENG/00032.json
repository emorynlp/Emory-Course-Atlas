    "class_notes": "In his book, Can Poetry Save The Earth? (2009) John Felstiner asks: Can poems help, when times demand environmental science and history, governmental leadership, corporate and consumer moderation, nonprofit activism, local initiatives?  Why call on the pleasures of poetry, when the time has come for an all out response? (xiii). In this course, we will address the potential answers to these questions by critically examining contemporary Indigenous and Black writings on Nature. Our critical readings and discussions will allow us to reflect on the historical relationships between Indigenous and Black peoples to lands, waters, plants, and animals, and how such relationships manifest within settler colonial contexts. Among other authors, we will spend time with Sherwin Bitsui, Joy Harjo, Langston Hughes, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, and Ofelia Zepeda.\n \nRequired Texts\n-Camile T. Dungy ed. Black Nature.
