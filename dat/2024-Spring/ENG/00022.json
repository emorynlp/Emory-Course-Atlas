    "class_notes": "In this class we will sample a variety of early American genres, relating them to one another by paying particular attention to their depictions and narrations of women and women¿s bodies in the period. We will look at how writers¿including both women and others¿represented female embodiment, and how ideas about womanhood and femaleness were formed in relation to race, disability, and sexuality during colonization and in the first decades of the United States. Texts will include Indigenous oral narratives, Puritan poetry and captivity narratives, natural histories, letters, pamphlets, and poetry from the Revolutionary period, early slave narratives, and two short novels: The Coquette and Hobomok. In addition to reading texts that we can access easily, we will spend time in the Rose Library looking at related archival material, including unpublished copybooks from Phillis Wheatley Peters, the first published Black American poet. We will explore all these texts through questions like: what was the role of gender and marked embodiment in the development of a colonial and then ¿American¿ identity? Where are there inheritances from this time period in our current moment, and what has been left behind? What can we learn by paying attention to which texts we have access to in the archive, and whose voices have been lost or ignored?",
