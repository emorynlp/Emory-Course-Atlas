    "class_notes": "\"Do these Jews writing in American make up a literary tradition?\" And, if so, what defines that tradition? So asked the editors of Jewish American Literature: A Norton Anthology. The answers to these questions are various. Maybe Jewish-American writers have a distinctive voice, or a relationship with Judaism's sacred texts, or maybe all that unites them is that they're Jewish. There are, after all, as many ways to be Jewish as there are Jews. In this course, we will read a broad swath of Jewish-American fiction, dating from the late nineteenth century through the twenty-first. Authors might include Abraham Cahan, Nathanael West, Tillie Olsen, Philip Roth, Fran Ross, Nicole Krauss, Joshua Cohen, and others. Students will learn close reading, the practice of paying attention to a short passage of text to account for its meaning and how it works. For almost a century, close reading has been central to literary studies because it offers the rigor of grounding general arguments in evidence drawn from the analysis of specific texts.",
