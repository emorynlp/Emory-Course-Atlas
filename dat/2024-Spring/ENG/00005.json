    "class_notes": "At the end of her most famous poem, poet Lucille Clifton issues an invitation to readers: \"come celebrate / with me that every day / something has tried to kill me / and has failed.\" This class is a celebration of the work and thought of Lucille Clifton, who is best known for her short but powerful affirmations of Black womanhood. As we follow the development of Clifton's poetry over the second half of the twentieth century and consider the social forces that might have tried to kill her, we will discuss her and her contemporaries' engagement with the most pressing political issues of their time, including: Black nationalism, reproductive rights, environmentalism, and reparations. The course will also work closely with the Rose Library to provide students access to Lucille Clifton's unpublished archives and manuscript drafts, which will serve as the basis for class projects and written assignments over the course of the semester.\nRequired text: Collected Poems of Lucille Clifton, 1965-2010, eds. Michael Glaser and Kevin Young",
