We will pay special attention to the cross-dressing comedies in which boy actors played women who disguise themselves as men,and consider what they say about the enactment of gender roles on stage and in society. We will also adopt an intersectional approach, considering the relations among gender, race, religion, and class. Plays to be read may include The Taming of the Shrew, The Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, Twelfth Night, and Measure for Measure.)",
