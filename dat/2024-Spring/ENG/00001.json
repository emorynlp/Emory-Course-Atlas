Ireland of Guinness and the Book of Kells. Which Ireland do we imagine is the real Ireland? As novelist Anne Enright puts it, \"Ireland is a series of stories it tells itself. None of them are true.\" We will read a wide range of Irish authors including W.B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, Eavan Boland, Brian Friel, Seamus Heaney, and other contemporary writers. Expect frequent writing posts, two papers, presentations, and a final project.)",
