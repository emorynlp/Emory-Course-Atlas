In this course, we will undertake a study of his work, with attention to his modernism and aesthetic experiments, the social and literary worlds that shaped his work, his global significance and reception, and his continuing interest for readers and writers in the 21st century.  \nTexts: The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Light in August, Absalom, Absalom!, The Wild Palms/If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem, and Go Down, Moses. Some texts provided by professor including short stories, William Faulkner: Early Prose and Poetry (ed. Carvel Collins) and New Orleans Sketches (Collins, ed.), We will examine some of his screenplays: Today We Live (1933), To Have and Have Not (1944), and The Big Sleep (1946).
