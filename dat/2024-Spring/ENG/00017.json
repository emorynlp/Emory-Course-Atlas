Much of the course will be devoted to a complete reading of MiltonÂ¿s masterpiece, the Biblical epic Paradise Lost. We will address his writing within its historical context, paying special attention to Milton's role in the English Civil War during which he served as Latin secretary for the revolutionary Commonwealth government and his relation to the changing gender roles of his time. We will also consider the major philosophical and religious themes of his writing, such as free will, the nature of divine providence, and the relation between liberty and obedience.",
