    "class_notes": "While we might think of doom scrolling as a passive activity, it also involves sorting through information of dubious accuracy and influence. Our information feeds are served to us based on data-driven assumptions about us, our values, and what we think is true--a fact that even conspiracy theorists leap at the chance to point out when provided expert recommendations. Threads and comment sections draw contrarians and trolls who gleefully tag (incorrect) logical fallacies, carefully equivocate, and shamelessly lie with statistics. Nefarious actors exploit the logics of digital platforms to gaslight and harass members of vulnerable online communities with brigades of sock puppets, while maintaining plausible deniability. Where are we to turn, as readers and writers, when faced with these erosions of expertise and civility? In this course, we will turn to rhetoric, which is not solely the study of persuasion, but also of how we negotiate cultural information and the power of language to affect social action. We will examine how authority is conferred in digital spaces and consider the tactics that undermine it, exercising methods to recognize and counter disinformation rather than recirculate it.",
