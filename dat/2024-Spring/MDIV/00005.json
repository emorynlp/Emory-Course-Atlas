    "course_description": "In the Spring semester of the first year, which for students who matriculate in spring will be their first semester and for students who matriculated in fall will be their second semester, students enroll in MDiv600. MDiv First Year Spring Seminar. Spring Seminars are integrative, theologically interdisciplinary, thematically focused first-year courses taught by faculty from different curricular areas. Each of these courses is designed to foster interdisciplinary engagement and extended conversation around a particular theme that matters for theological education. This course serves as a curricular center of gravity, cultivating small learning communities that support and nurture theological formation while allowing students, including those who enter the MDiv program for the first time in a Spring semester, to explore their own motivating questions.",
