We will examine Zamiatin's anti-utopia \"We\" which parodied the Soviet Union and provoked Orwell's review. Students will be acquainted with the fantastic grotesque story of devilish miracles in the Soviet country in Mikhail Bulgakov's story \"Dog's Heart\" , the ironic narrative discourse of Mikhail Zoshchenko's stories, the absurdism of D. Kharms's prose and poetry, and Andrei Platonov's tragic-parodic prose (\"Makar the Doubting,\" \"The State Resident\".) All these satirical political discourses serve as a means of investigating social life, its processes, and trends.",
