We will discuss and analyze fictional works, films, music and primary sources, in order to understand and learn how Portuguese speakers have faced challenges such as dictatorships, immigration and emigration, as well as racial, gender and social inequality issues that have been historically present in Lusophone countries. Students will learn to recognize aesthetic constructs, the representation of genre differences and similarities, ideological trends, and historical contexts, as well as formulate responses in Portuguese to the various themes addressed in the different texts and films, both orally and in writing. Students will be required to compose creative and analytical responses to the course materials and will revise their compositions with feedback from their peers and instructor. We will review Portuguese grammar with an emphasis on verbs and their complements (prepositions), pronouns and the nuances of the Portuguese language structure. All classes will be conducted in Portuguese. PREREQUISITES: Port 201 or equivalent (including courses taken during a study abroad program).",
