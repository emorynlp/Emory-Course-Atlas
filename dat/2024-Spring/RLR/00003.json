What did this place mean at various points in the past to different groups of peoples? What are its components, and how are they sacred? What purposes do they served then, and which ones do they serve now? What are they designed to do? What contribution do they make to a religious tradition? To lived religion? To lack of religiosity? How do they relate to each other? When? This course is designed to help students develop a clear understanding of natural and architectural works considered sacred, and the role they play in the historical and/or religious memory of the civilizations to which they belong. The seminar pays attention to natural and architectural works such as mosques, bedrooms, studies, forts, temples, palatial compounds, courts, churches, prayer rooms, hybrid monuments, basilicas, landscapes, gardens, sites of hydraulics and water management, cities, and world heritage sites.\n\n\nCourse evaluation:\nAttendance and participation: 30%\nWeekly written reflection: 20%\nPoster/class presentation: 10%\nFinal research project: 40%",
