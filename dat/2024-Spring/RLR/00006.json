    "course_description": "The act of reading is arguably central to numerous religious traditions and also to the scholarly life of those who study religion. Frequently, however, we neglect to ask about the role of the reader in both the traditions we study and in our own scholarship. By placing the reader at the center of our inquiry, this seminar prompts us to consider how reading practices shape understanding both for practitioners and for scholars of religion. Our first task is to come to terms with how we read the texts that we study, and we do this through engagement with theoretical writings in reader response theory, semiotics, and literary criticism. Turning then to specific examples from religious traditions, we next draw on the history of reading, as well as ethnography and theology, to ask about the intertextual, performative and embodied aspects of the act of reading and to problematize our assumptions about what may be at stake in religious reading. Finally, we end the course with a consideration of the political dimensions of reading, examining works of history as well as womanist, feminist, and Black theology. Throughout the course, we will continually revisit the difficult questions of how we as readers can approach religious texts if we remain outside of the traditional interpretive community of religious readers, and also what it means to be part of the interpretive community of scholars of religion who study religious texts and religious reading.",
