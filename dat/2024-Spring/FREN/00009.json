How - beyond traditional anthropocentrism - can we respond and be responsible to nonhuman beings? How should we conceive of and care for their strange proximity to us and their undeniable difference? Are these concerns separate from or entangled with issues of social and political justice? And are these questions contemporary - are they generated by the ongoing climate catastrophe and emergent ecological consciousness - or have they been with us for centuries and become, now, only far more urgent? Exploring these and related issues, students will closely study and collectively discuss texts while undertaking assignments ranging from the analytic to the experimental.",
