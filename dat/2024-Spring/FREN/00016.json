While claiming that drive theory is 'indispensable,' Freud acknowledged that he only 'painfully felt' his way toward the drives and their vicissitudes. We will trace some of the steps of this painstaking analysis before turning to Laplanche's reevaluation of Freud's 'seduction theory,' an extension that affirms the primacy of the other against a certain theoretical self-centering, and proposes a new understanding of the drives. Finally, we will address Lyotard's philosophical elaboration of the drives (the 'death drive' in particular) in texts such as Discourse, Figure and Libidinal Economy.)\n\n\nTexts may include: \nFreud: Instincts and their Vicissitudes; Three Essays on Sexuality; Beyond the Pleasure Principle; A Child is Being Beaten: A Contribution to the Study of the Origin of Sexual Perversions; The Economic Problem of Masochism \nLaplanche:  Freud and the Sexual [selections]; New Foundations for Psychoanalysis [selections]; Essays on Otherness [selections]; Life and Death in Psychoanalysis [selections] \nLyotard:   Discourse, Figure [selections]; Libidinal Economy [selections]; 'Painting as a Libidinal set-up'",
