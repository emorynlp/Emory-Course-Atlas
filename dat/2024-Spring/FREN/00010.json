We will explore water issues as a key to understanding human cultures and human relationships with the environment. The study of water issues offers an interesting opportunity to engage in an interdisciplinary inquiry since water is essential in human life and functioning of human societies. Our study will focus on the intersection of environmental issues and culture, industrialization, economic inequity, environmental injustice, social injustice, postcolonial economy, and racism. Students will develop a vocabulary for thinking and talking about the explored themes. We will also analyze the role of art in the struggle for environmental issues.\n\n\nLearning Objectives: describe studied environmental and ecological concepts;\ncritically analyze and debate environmental issues; examine lifestyle issues and critically analyze the relationships between population, natural resources, land use, industrialization, and pollution; develop a broad understanding of the place of humans in the nature and evaluate practices of humans as they interact with their environment; develop knowledge and skills to work toward solutions to environmental problems; develop skills that showcase an integrated adaptation of new vocabulary and new ideas.\nParticulars\nActive participation, CANVAS short responses, 1 oral presentation, 2 papers (3 pages each).",
