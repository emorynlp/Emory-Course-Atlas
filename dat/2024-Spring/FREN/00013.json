In addition to close readings of the Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles, Marguerite de Navarre, Catherine Bernard, Madame de Lafayette, Madame D¿Aulnoy, and Charles Perrault, the seminar will also seek to reconnect early-modern storytelling practices with the work of contemporary artists and activists engaged in redefining the good life. Taught in French and English.",
