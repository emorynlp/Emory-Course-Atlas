Please contact Sadie Hannans (sadie.marie.hannans@emory.edu) for permission to enroll.\n\n\nThis course provides a rigorous introduction to the field of social choice theory. Social choice theory analyzes how groups of people should and do make collective decisions. It takes a collection of people with well-defined and heterogeneous preferences as an input and then examines the different ways in which we can construct a group preference from these inputs. The construction is achieved through the use of a preference aggregation rule which could be equivalent to a voting rule or something else entirely. The goal of the class is to examine the properties of different types of rules, and to characterize rules that yield desirable group outcomes.\nThe elegance and power of many social choice-theoretic results such as Arrow's impossibility theorem, the McKelvey-Schofield chaos theorems, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, and the Plott conditions have changed the way that social scientists think about decision making procedures and outcomes. The influence of social choice influence extends across disciplines in the social and behavioral sciences with applications in political science, economics, sociology, information science, environmental management, and health sciences.",
