You will develop a broad theoretical understanding of fundamental auditing concepts (e.g., assertions, audit risk, materiality, risk assessment, client acceptance, planning, internal control, evidence, reporting, audit quality). The course will provide you with an understanding of why auditors do the things they do (or, in some cases, why they should do the things they should do).",
