Is gender an environmental input or a behavioral output? How do social conceptions of gender impact our scientific understanding of sex? In this course, students will examine neuroscience and biology from an intersectional feminist perspective, first delving into sexed biologies and social constructions of gender before collapsing the sex-gender divide to examine how these two racialized concepts co-create one another. Discussions will also include intersex and trans identities and materialities.",
