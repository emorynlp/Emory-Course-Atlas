    "class_notes": "This course will focus on the functional consequences of protein structure in the context of the nervous system. We will explore molecular structure-function relationships that affect neuronal function and, thus, behavior. Topics may include the molecular basis of channel mutations that cause epilepsy, autoimmune conditions, chemical warfare, drug design, and other topics of students¿ choice. In this class, we will use case studies and other active-learning activities to drive our exploration of molecular interactions underlying behavior. Assessments will include student presentations, individual and collaborative quizzes, and other assignments.\nParticulars\n¿\tPrerequisites: Previous completion of Chem 204 and/or Bio 301 is required. Completion of NBB301/Bio360 and/or Psych110 is strongly recommended.\nTextbook: Basic Neurochemistry 8th Edition: Brady, Siegel, Albers, and Price available online through Emory Libraries here: ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/emory/detail.action?docID=806483",
