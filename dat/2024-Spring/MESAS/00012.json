We will examine historical processes which have led to the development of certain foodways and explore the ways that these traditions play out on the ground today. We will begin by examining some examples of culinary tradition in different South Asian spaces both in the past and present. We'll be moving on to see how cooking traditions changed and morphed as people moved across oceans and land. We'll investigate Caribbean, American (United States), and other Diasporic traditions, examining the ways people of South Asian descent influenced cooking, eating and meaning in the new cultural worlds they entered and how the local traditions in these new spaces had an influence on these cooks' culinary experiences.\nWe will focus on the art of cuisine through the analysis of texts, films, and cultural events. We will mainly focus on:\n- History of spices\n- Culinary styles\n- Birth of few important South Asian dishes\n- Concept and culture of community eating)\n*We will also be cooking together four times in the semester.",
