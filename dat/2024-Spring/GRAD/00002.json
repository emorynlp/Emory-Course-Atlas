Public Humanities engages debates about the relation of humanistic inquiry to communal engagement and stimulates active, collaborative, research of broad public interest. At the center of this course will be projects developed in collaboration with community partners in a wide range of fields inside and outside the university that engage students in socially-meaningful scholarship. Weekly seminar meetings will provide an opportunity to discuss readings about the history and theory of humanities in general and the emerging field of Public Humanities in particular, and will afford time for group work on the collaborative research projects. Brief presentations and short writing assignments will serve to encourage reflection on connections between disciplinary research and Public Humanities practice.",
