These threaten community well-being, people's aspirations for the future, and the very livability of different parts of the planet. How do governments respond to these growing calamities? Through a case study of the US Federal Disaster Recovery & Mitigation process, this course will provide students insight into the practice, management and implementation of federal disaster response programs.\nDisaster response includes both addressing immediate hardships and long-term recovery programs that cover infrastructure, housing, and economic development needs. In this course, students will gain concrete skills by considering these challenges through a case scenario: they will create an Action Plan to demonstrate community needs following a disaster and future disaster risks and prepare for the implementation of a disaster recovery program of their choosing.\nTaught by consultant practitioners working in Disaster Recovery, the course provides unique insight into federal grant management processes, monitoring and auditing, and the role of specialized consultants. Given the increasing pace of climate disasters, such skills will be sure to serve students with many development interests.",
