Using a case-study approach that draws on the instructor's experience in international water and sanitation, the course examines the actors, their agendas and strategies, and the political, social, legal and economic systems in which they operate. Special emphasis is given to the role of research and scientific evidence in environmental health policymaking. Readings, discussion and occasional guest speakers also explore issues of equity and environmental justice.",
