It is becoming increasingly clear that effective managers and executives demonstrate both business acumen and people acumen. This course concentrates on the latter - developing your skills as a leader and as a follower. The course is designed to enhance your understanding of self, best practices in leadership behaviors, and how to bring out the leadership potential in those around you.",
