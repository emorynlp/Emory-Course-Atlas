    "class_notes": "While most people list happiness as one of their central life goals, people are surprisingly bad at knowing what will make them happy. In this course, we will explore what science can tell us about what actually makes people happy both personally and professionally. We will begin by examining how scientists define and measure happiness and some of the benefits of happiness for individuals and organizations. Next, we will examine the features of our minds that often make us less happy and how to combat them. We will then turn to what science can teach us about how to be happier, less stressed, and more fulfilled in our personal and professional lives. Students will have multiple opportunities to put these practices into action and will be encouraged to develop ways to build them into their current and future lives.",
