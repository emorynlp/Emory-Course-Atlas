Ambedkar, two of the most exceptional leaders among the makers of modern India Gandhi, hailed as \"Father of the nation\", votary of non-violence, inspiration to Martin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (the Frontier Gandhi) and many more; Ambedkar, first Law Minister of independent India, architect of the Indian constitution, and acknowledged leader of the most stigmatized and marginalized castes and classes in the land, are often seen as antagonists. Yet, their work converged in several ways, not least in their advocacy of non-violent revolution. Through a close reading of selections from their most important writings, autobiographical and other, and critical commentaries by scholars and activists across the world, the seminar examines the meaning of their respective philosophical and political endeavors, and the kind of society and nation the two leaders dreamed of.",
