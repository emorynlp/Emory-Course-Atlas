    "class_notes": "\"Unspeakable Things Unspoken - Close Listening to America\": What does it mean to be American? Who counts as American; and who doesn't? Who gets to decide? These are the broad questions that American Studies asks, and we will unveil them not only by reading texts, but by listening to them. Specifically, this course will practice close listening to investigate, along with the above queries, what America sounds like and how understanding its sound(s) might help us negotiate American identity, knowledge production, and history.\nThrough examining a range of literature, art, and film, this course considers how various artists have debated \"Americanness\" as well as how they have sounded it, which is to say how they have represented America and (un)belonging musically, noisily, or even silently. We will analyze texts that center themes of spectatorship, liberation, humor, memory, and situating one's out-of-placeness physically and linguistically in a country that continues to grapple with its own self-definition. Artists may include but are not limited to W.E.B Du Bois, George Schuyler, Alice Childress, Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, Mart Crowley, Bo Burnham, Suzan-Lori Parks, Ocean Vuong, Leonard Bernstein, Mat Johnson, Reggie Watts, and Jordan Peele. Visits to the Stuart A. Rose Library and Alliance Theatre are likely.",
