    "class_notes": "Advertising is everywhere-in the magazines we read, on the television we watch, popping up in our social media feeds, even on the T-shirts we wear.  Some estimate that we see as many as 5000 ads every day.  Yet we rarely take the time to analyze the ways these ubiquitous ads affect us, as individuals and as a society.  This course will do just that. \nWe will examine advertising in American culture through a number of lenses.  We will begin with an historical analysis-how did advertising grow from a relatively small industry to the powerhouse it is today?  We will analyze advertisements as texts-how does advertising convey its messages in both overt and covert ways?  How do ads indicate the cultural norms and attitudes of society?  We will examine the ways advertising influences and produces our consumer culture, and we will discuss the effects advertising has on cultural change-does it act as a progressive or a conservative force?  Overall, the course will provide an introduction to the critical study of advertising and its role in creating and sustaining cultural attitudes and ideologies.",
