Experiential learning combines training in historical archival research, digital mapping using geographical information systems (GIS), and engagement with the materials and methods of Native American and Indigenous Studies. This course investigates Atlanta's history in relation to Native American nations of the Southeast, with special attention to entangled histories of Native dispossession, slavery, segregation, and Indigenous erasure in the built environment of present-day Atlanta.",
