    "course_description": "This course provides an exploration of the establishment and growth of Christianity in Africa. Regional experiences and developments form the building blocks of the study. But the assessment aims less to provide detailed historical coverage of the church in every region of the subcontinent than to negotiate major themes, currents and developments constituent to the rise of African Christianity-including the vital role of indigenous religious culture and the interaction with Islam. The significance of colonialism as well as the role and impact of Western missionary enterprise form an overarching theme, but central emphasis will be placed on African initiatives, agency and enterprise as indispensable elements in the development and prospects of the African Church. The emergence of African Christianity as a major factor within world Christianity will also receive attention. (Race, Ethnicity, and Gender).",
