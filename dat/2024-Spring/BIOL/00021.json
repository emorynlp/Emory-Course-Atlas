This course will provide students with an introduction to cellular and integrative neurobiology. Topics include the electrochemical and biophysical mechanisms for neuronal signaling and synaptic transmission, and the neural bases of behavior and perception. There is an optional 2-credit hour lab (Biology 360L/NBB 301L) associated with the course. Prerequisites: as listed for the course plus Math 116 and Introductory Physics are strongly recommended.)",
