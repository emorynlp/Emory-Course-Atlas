This course covers ecology and systems biology of species interactions, with a focus on microbial and microbiome ecology, including interactions between microbes and their hosts. This course relies heavily on the primary literature, and a basic familiarity with college-level calculus is recommended. Prerequisites: Biology 142, Biology 142L, and Biology 370. This course may be taken as elective credit for the biology major and fulfills a WRITING REQUIREMENT for the GERs.",
