The class will follow the lifecycle of a business bankruptcy, through (among other things) pre-petition negotiations, the first day hearing, and plan/sale issues. Students will take turns acting on behalf of the debtor, creditors, secured lenders, and the United States Trustee, and will perform practice-based skills such as communicating with the client, preparing and performing a pitch, negotiating with opposing counsel, and drafting then arguing a matter before the court. Prerequisite: bankruptcy.",
