    "course_description": "The study of case law and the formal litigation process and the role it plays in our society is essential to effective lawyering. Yet less than 2% of civil cases are resolved by trial. This experiential course will explore the use of appropriate dispute resolution processes -negotiation, mediation and arbitration, and various hybrids - by which most legal conflicts are resolved.\nThe course will provide practical skills and experience through a combination of lecture-discussion, exercises, and simulations to ground students in both ADR theory and practice.",
