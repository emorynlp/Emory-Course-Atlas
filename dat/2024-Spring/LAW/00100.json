This course employs a multifaceted approach designed to capture dynamic interaction between law and business. This approach builds on the integration of two distinct modules, namely legal foundation and business application, and integrates the legal research process with the business analysis process through modular division and interaction. Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to achieve enhanced familiarity with finding and using legal and business-related resources and to gain a broader perspective of analyzing legal issues in the diverse business context.",
