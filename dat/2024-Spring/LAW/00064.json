    "course_description": "This course will examine the fundamental and unpredictable twenty-first century upheaval in human society-including politics, economics, communications, education, social media, commerce, human relationships, and of course, law and the nature of rightsÂ¿through which we are living.  Much of our work will be organized around a recent, highly celebrated book:  Shoshana Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalizm: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power (2019).\nExamples of the specific topics covered in the course are: (1) Government efforts to gather both the metadata and the contents of electronic messages, including phone calls, emails, and text messages. (2) Corporate efforts to gather data about users, to mine that data for commercially useful information, and to sell it to other entities. How companies like Facebook and Google gather and profit from the user data they gather will part of this discussion.",
