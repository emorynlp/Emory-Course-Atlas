The course introduces students to business and legal issues common to commercial transactions, such as M&A deals, license agreements, commercial real estate transactions, financing transactions, and other typical transactions. Students learn to interview, counsel, and communicate with simulated clients; conduct various types of due diligence; translate a business deal into contract provisions; understand basic transaction structure, finance, and risk reduction techniques; and negotiate and collaboratively draft an agreement for a simulated transaction. Classes involve both individual and group work, with in class exercises, role-plays and oral reports supported by lecture and weekly homework assignments. Note: Open enrollment will be available to non-transactional certificate students on a space-available basis to students with required pre-reqs once open enrollment starts.",
