    "course_description": "This course is designed to give students an understanding of what modern corporate espionage is and how these matters are handled by practicing lawyers. These matters are technologically complex (e.g., involving digital forensics experts, etc.) and involve multiple substantive legal areas (e.g., advanced civil procedure intellectual property, labor and employment, antitrust, etc.). The course is designed in two parts.\nPart I (weeks 1-7) is focused primarily on reading and case/issue analysis with discussions around practical considerations to get students familiar with the various topics involved in this area of practice. Students will draft short briefs each week on issues relevant to the weekly topics.\nPart II requires students to engage in practical assignments built around two hypothetical fact patterns involving corporate espionage that begins with an investigation and proceeds through the typical course of litigation.",
