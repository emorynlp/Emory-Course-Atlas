    "course_description": "Rights in tort, contract, and constitutional law are enforced in court. Whether the remedies that enforce rights are part of the substantive right or supplementary to it, remedies are theoretical and practically essential in understanding, and being fully equipped to practice in, both private and public law. This course will cover legal and equitable remedies. Restitution and monetary damages (including the \"rightful position\" principle, consequential damages, and damages for dignitary and constitutional harms) form the core, while injunctions \"preventive, reparative, and structural\" supplement remedies with which students will be familiar from courses in torts, contracts, property, and constitutional law. Other topics will include declarative judgments, contempt, and attorneys' fees, which are necessary to understanding the power of the courts to deliver justice.",
