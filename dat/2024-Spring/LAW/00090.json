    "course_description": "The goal of this course is to introduce students to legal issues surrounding federal and state budgeting in the United States with an emphasis on structures and inter-disciplinary perspectives.  The semester will begin with an introduction to federal budgeting and discuss the budget process as a tool of fiscal control.  We will then discuss the budget process as a tool of influence for executive and legislative branch actors, before turning to the role of federal courts.  Having worked through the roles in budgeting of the three branches of the federal government, we will next take up selected topics associated with budgeting in the states and federal-state fiscal interactions including fiscal federalism, public health litigation proceeds, and dedicated revenue provisions.  Students will also be expected to do their own original research on an issue of their choosing related to federal or state budget policy.",
