Topics include jurisdictional issues, forum selection, international service of process, international discovery, international choice of law, proving foreign law in U.S. courts, multiple proceedings (including parallel proceedings and interim/interlocutory assistance) and enforcement of foreign judgments. Brief mention will also be made of international commercial arbitration and international commercial mediation. The focus is primarily on private international actors, though special issues relating to the sovereign immunity of foreign states and state actors will also be addressed. The course is doctrinal, but also includes discussion of strategic and transactional considerations.",
