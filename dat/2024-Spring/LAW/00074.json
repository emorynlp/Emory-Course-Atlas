For Spring Semester 2024, topics would include: Fair Use after the Supreme Court decision in Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith (expected any day now), the ¿authorship¿ requirement in an era of developing AI technology, the impact of digital self-publishing on the publishing industry and the application of copyright law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and its use/abuse on Tik Tok and You Tube, and the Infringement Suit Boom in the music industry in the wake of high profile decisions on Led Zeppelin¿s Stairway to Heaven, Robin Thicke¿s Blurred Lines and Ed Sheeran¿s multiple cases. In each topic, the class will discuss both the fundamental Copyright rules and their application in each developing segment of the current environment.",
