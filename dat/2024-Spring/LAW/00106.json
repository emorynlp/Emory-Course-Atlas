Topics will include the U.S. civil rights movement, the movements for womenÂ¿s equality, LGBTQ rights, free speech rights for dissidents, freedom of the press and other topics.

Board of Education litigation to contemporary uses of history in Supreme Court advocacy. Students will write research papers on a topic in the history of law and social change.\nCourse requirements: Students will write weekly reaction papers based on the readings and write a research paper of at least 10,000 words (which is approximately 30 pages).",
