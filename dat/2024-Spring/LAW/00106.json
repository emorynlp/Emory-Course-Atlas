This seminar will provide an overview of the main academic theories of corporate governance and examine some of the ongoing debates about the efficacy and adequacy of recent reforms. The primary focus of the seminar in Spring 2024 will be on the rise of the ESG movement in corporate law and the recent backlash against it.",
