    "course_description": "This course examines core concepts of sentencing in criminal cases in the United States. Our primary focus will be on the role of the judiciary in balancing society's often competing interests in crime prevention and individual liberties. Students will explore the historical and theoretical underpinnings and the present-day application of criminal sentencing practices in state and federal courts, including incarceration, capital punishment, probation, parole, and post-conviction obligations. The course will involve substantive discussions of the normative side of sentencing, including competing policy considerations and social science research regarding sentencing practices. Throughout the semester, we will consider issues such as sentencing disparities, problems associated with mass incarceration, and criminal justice system reform.",
