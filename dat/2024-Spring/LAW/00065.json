    "course_description": "This course will walk students through modern data privacy practice and the important tangential corporate laws and regulations governing how global corporations comply with the myriad of privacy laws and regulations to which they are subject. Since the modern practice of privacy law is focused on how corporations gather, process, and store personal data, this course will focus on areas of the law important to in-house corporate practitioners and the lawyers that advise in-house practitioners. The goal of the course is to produce highly competent privacy practitioners ready to take in-house and law firm jobs advising businesses.",
