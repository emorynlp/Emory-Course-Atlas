    "course_description": "This course teaches students to view energy issues in the context of the relationship between energy and other aspects of life including national security, economic development, natural resource management, and human nature. The material is presented from a \"real world\" perspective, and students are encouraged to look at energy-related issues as would an energy lawyer. The course involves significant reading that a practicing lawyer would perform to advise a client about energy issues. Students are encouraged to question every aspect of the law so as to better understand the historical, economic and political influences that give rise to and lead to changes in the legal framework that applies to energy.",
