Criminal Procedure (Adjudication) will be helpful, but is not required.  This is a writing course, so there will be no final exam, but instead, a series of writing assignments throughout the semester.\nThis course is eligible to be counted towards the requirements for the J.D. concentration in Criminal Litigation.",
    "course_description": "In this course, we will explore how a person who has been convicted of a crime can challenge his or her conviction in the criminal legal system, with a focus on Georgia state courts and federal courts. What are the options for challenging a conviction, either via a direct appeal or through post-conviction options, such as a habeas petition? Topics include the difference between direct appeals and post-conviction relief, the interplay between the state and federal courts as state defendants challenge their convictions, how to define the record for a direct appeal, appellate jurisdiction, preservation of appellate issues, standards of review, and ineffective assistance of counsel claims. This course is meant to be practical, so that students will learn how to do appeals or post-conviction work, but it will also provide guidance on how to represent clients at the trial level while anticipating an appeal. This class satisfies the \"skills-based\" course requirement for the criminal litigation concentration.",
