Students should be prepared to discuss health outcomes brought on by combat, sexual violence, and other forms of traumatic injury.  We will learn the history of trauma through a careful study of fictional narratives, poetry, testimonials, philosophical essays, and clinical case-studies. We will also debate the consequences of our expanding sense of trauma in contemporary culture through popular notions of triggeredness, microaggressions, victimhood, safe spaces, etc.",
