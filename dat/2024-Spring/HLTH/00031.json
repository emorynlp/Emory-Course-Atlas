The purpose of this interdisciplinary course is to examine birth in the context of global health. Meanings and practices around this event will be explored across diverse historical and socio-cultural contexts, highlighting themes of empowerment, joy, risk, and fear. Urgent problems in global reproductive health and their potential solutions will also be evaluated, including maternal mortality, reproductive rights and equity, and access to quality health care in both community and institutional settings. An additional area of focus involves the care that midwives contribute as they attend women in pregnancy, birth, and beyond.",
