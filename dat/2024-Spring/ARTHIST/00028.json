In ancient Egypt it formed part of a long tradition of texts written specifically to accompany the dead in the tomb, distinguished especially by its rich use of images illustrating, complementing, or interpreting the textual contents. In modern times, in turn, this visual splendor seemingly confirmed the expectation that the Book described and depicted ancient Egyptian conceptions of the afterlife. This seminar explores different aspects of this important ancient Egyptian work, including the interplay between text and image, the deployment of its texts and imagery in different media, the possibility of reconstructing its original cultural contexts, and its reception in modern scholarship and popular culture.)",
