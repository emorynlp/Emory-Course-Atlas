This first-year seminar works backward from Recasting Antiquity: Whistler, Tanagra, and the Female Form, an exhibition opening at the Carlos Museum on February 3, 2024, to examine the sometimes fraught curatorial decisions, design considerations, and art-historical assumptions that underlie its organization and presentation. By ¿deconstructing¿ Recasting Antiquity, students will imagine their way into the roles of curator, designer, conservator, art historian, and art critic, learning to look at an exhibition from the inside out. We will engage such questions as how curators formulate the ideas realized by exhibitions; how designers translate those concepts into pleasing visual arguments; and why museums risk lending objects to other institutions ¿in short, what is gained by bringing objects together, and what might be lost? We will take advantage of the visiting works of art to study them at close hand and increase our expertise in Hellenistic terracotta figurines (ca. 330¿200 BCE), mostly on loan from the Louvre, and the works on paper made under their influence by the American artist James McNeill Whistler (1834¿1903). Class activities include exhibition visits, written exercises, oral presentations, visiting speakers, and a field trip to the High Museum of Art.)",
