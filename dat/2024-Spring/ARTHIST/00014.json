As a painter who was keenly aware of the history of art, her sources ranged from Jackson Pollock to Persian miniatures. Frankenthaler also shaped artistic production from the 1960s to the present; feminist artists in particular have developed an enduring (and sometimes strained) relationship with her work. Throughout the class, we will be concerned with contemporary issues in art history, including class consciousness, feminism, gender norms, and Frankenthaler's place in an increasingly global narrative of abstraction.)\n(Art History major/minor: Division III)",
