From the earliest signs of urban society to the epoch-shifting Late Bronze Age Collapse, we will consider how arts and material culture as varied as architecture, ceramics, glyptics, sculpture, and metalwork can be used to understand these ancient cultures and the complex web of trade and migration that formed the world's first truly global system. The course will consist of lectures, structured group assignments, and in-class examinations.)\nArt History major/minor: Division I\nArchitectural Studies minor: elective",
