    "class_notes": "Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs were in use for well over three thousand years, offering the modern observer a unique window into the thoughts of the ancient Egyptians. Hieroglyphic signs often double as elements of iconography in Egyptian art, and many works of sculpture, relief, and painting contain regular inscriptions that can aid in the interpretation and appreciation of the artworks, from brief identifications of people, things, and actions to lengthy narratives or ritual recitations. This course offers an introduction to the hieroglyphic writing system and the Middle Egyptian language in which most inscriptions are composed, drawing on textbook lessons and exercises as well as practical studies of inscribed objects from the Michael C. Carlos Museum.\nArt History major/minor: Division I",
