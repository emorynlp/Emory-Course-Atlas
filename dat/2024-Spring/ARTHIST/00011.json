Course units will focus on the paintings, sculptures, architecture, and material and visual culture more broadly of India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Tibet. We will examine Jain, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim religious art, asking how these material objects relate to religious texts and practices. While loosely chronological, the course is also structured around the contents of the Asian Collection at the Carlos Museum. Most weeks, we will spend one class meeting at the Carlos Museum. These class meetings, along with the readings and writing assignments, will also allow us to address a host of questions pertinent to the study of religion and art in general: What is art? How can art be understood as \"secular\" or \"religious\"? How can religious imagery be used to construct national identities, to sell a product, or to teach a philosophical doctrine? By examining the different ways in which various communities have used visual and material culture throughout a period of nearly 5,000 years, we can see more clearly the contingency of \"religion\" and \"art\" through specific contexts.",
