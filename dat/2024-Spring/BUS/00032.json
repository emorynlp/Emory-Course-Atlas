It's true, filmmaking can be viewed as a massive gamble and it's hard to predict what will resonate with an audience. Today, hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake to build the largest tentpoles, and complicating things in the contemporary film industry are mergers & acquisitions, competition for talent, and new economic models led primarily by the era of streaming.  There is a lot to understand and plenty to learn to help guide your interests and success in this most complex, evolving, and competitive industry. This seminar is designed to give you an understanding of how the gears turn in the film business - behind the glamour, the media, the movie stars, and the film festivals.  Topics we'll cover include an understanding of the fundamental roles industry players take on with each produced film, how to examine each film as it's own business, how content consumption is affecting film viewership and ever-evolving, and a comprehensive look at how a film is built from idea to release.",
