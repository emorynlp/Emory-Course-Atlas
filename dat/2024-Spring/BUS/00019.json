With the feverish pace of technology, the proliferation of Social Media giving a voice to all, the rise of Web 3.0, and the need for creativity to solve brands' business challenges more than ever before, marketing is exciting and ever-changing. But one thing always remains: the need for curious, modern marketers on both the agency and client sides of the business. In this seminar, students will learn about how the industry actually works, especially around the client/agency dynamic. We'll talk about the role each plays in the marketing ecosystem, and begin to develop the practical skills you need to land your first job.",
