Sprinkle in billionaire competitors, brilliant young talent, a huge future market, and a general lack of rationale business sense, and you have a decade worth of insights from running a space startup. \n     But this seminar isn't just crazy stories. It turns out there is real value in space, and that running a company has many of the same challenges regardless of industry.",
