You have just been tasked with your first project on the job, and it requires gathering secondary information and data. Chances are your company does not license most or any of the databases and resources that you had access to as a BBA student, but the expectation that you deliver credible and competitive data and insights is extremely high. This class will help give you the tools and the confidence that you need to conduct solid business intelligence and build a strong evidence-based case for your work projects. \nThe instructors will share insights and strategies for conducting credible business research on industries, companies and competitors, global business issues, social enterprise, disruption, innovation, and more. They will also touch on the strategies, challenges, and risks of embracing generative AI for making business decisions. Each session will focus on different topics and will include interactive case studies so that you can explore and experiment with your newfound knowledge and skills. By the end of the series, you will know how to conduct smart business research and be able to build an effective and evidence-based case to present to your client or employer.",
