Debate assigns participants randomly to advocate a particular side of a topic, thus removing fear of offending management. Assigned argument has strong applications for workplace advocacy in settings from conferences to meetings to government hearings. Critical thinking is a process. The resulting skill set encourages rapid assessment, synthesis, and persuasive delivery of ideas and programs.\n     This seminar will provide practical strategies for persuasion in business. The class will construct arguments, debate in teams, and develop critical thinking, reading and communication skills.",
