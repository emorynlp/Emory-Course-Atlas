It explores the historical origins, psychological mechanisms, and economic consequences of financial bubbles and crashes, such as the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, the Dot-com Bubble, and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. It also analyzes the role of financial innovation, regulation, and social media in creating and bursting these bubbles. The course draws on historical sources, economic theory, and empirical evidence to provide students with a comprehensive and critical understanding of the history of money, markets, and manias in the 20th century.",
