    "course_description": "This course will examine the principles that govern the interactions of atoms and molecules with electromagnetic radiation. The topics covered will include rotational, vibrational and electronic spectroscopy. For each sub-topic we will examine the quantum mechanical energy level structures associated with the atoms or molecules, and the spectra that arise from transitions between stationary states. Familiarity with basic quantum mechanics and perturbation theory is assumed. This course will be of value to students working in both experimental and theoretical research areas.",
