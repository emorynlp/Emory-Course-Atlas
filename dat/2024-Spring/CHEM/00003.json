    "class_notes": "In this course, students will learn, in a hands-on setting, how to make new substances, as well as how to isolate, identify, and quantify them. The development of a meaningful understanding of intermolecular forces and how these determine the physical properties of a material is a major theme of these studies.",
    "course_description": "Students will learn several methods for separating and identifying small molecule organic reactants and products. They will make qualitative determinations based on quantitative data and equilibria and acid base properties. Students who withdraw from the laboratory course should withdraw from the co-requisite lecture course.",
