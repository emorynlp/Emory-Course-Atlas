    "course_description": "Chemistry 524 is a problem-solving course in spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques used for the structural characterization of organic compounds. Methods to be studied include nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 2D), infrared spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. A major part of the course will be focused on problem-solving techniques, including the integrated application of spectroscopic and spectrometry techniques to determine structures of polyfunctionalized organic compounds.",
