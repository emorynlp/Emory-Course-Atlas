We consider air, water, soil, animal, and human influences, with case studies on each of these factors. The course covers methods used in the study of infectious diseases, including epidemiology, mathematical modeling, risk analysis, social science, ecology, and molecular biology. Students will learn to think from the perspective of a pathogen trying to maximize its fitness over both short- and long-term time scales. It is helpful if students have some background in biology.",
