Exposure science approaches across media, including air, water, soil, and internal biological matrices, will be considered. Direct monitoring, modeling, and biomarkers of exposure will be presented and discussed. Students will examine the literature of exposure science through readings, in-class article discussions, and by conducting a collaborative exposure assessment study evaluating the aggregate exposure and the exposome of nitrogen-containing compounds in the environment.",
