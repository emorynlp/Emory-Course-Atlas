The course exposes students to the methodologies, use cases, and hands-on experiences with FinTech in financial intermediation (e.g., banking, credit, payments). The topics include big data, machine learning, automation, digital payments, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, and equity crowdfunding. In addition to learning about the foundations of these technologies, students will write scripts for collecting and processing big data, learn how to build classification trees, and use machine-learning techniques for predictive modeling of FinTech loan defaults. The course is delivered through interactive lecturettes, in-class activities, and group projects. The course is most relevant for consulting, investment banking, private equity, entrepreneurship, and corporate finance roles",
