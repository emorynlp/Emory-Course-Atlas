Under the mentorship of corporate coaches, student teams will work as analysts to combine capital with conscience and develop an investment opportunity that makes the world a better place.  Using the capital markets to address a pressing social, economic or environment issue (such as water, energy, food or education) students draw on their analytical skills, financial acumen and professional expertise. Teams may develop their ideas using a combination of investment styles and tools and will showcase their investment pitches to a panel of corporate leaders.",
