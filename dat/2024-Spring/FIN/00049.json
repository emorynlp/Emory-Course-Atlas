    "course_description": "This practicum course bridges theory and practice in the Finance Lab.  Under the mentorship of corporate coaches, student teams will work as analysts to combine capital with conscience and develop an investment opportunity that makes the world a better place.  Using the capital markets to address a pressing social, economic or environment issue (such as water, energy, food or education) students draw on their analytical skills, financial acumen and professional expertise. Teams may develop their ideas using a combination of investment styles and tools and will showcase their investment pitches to a panel of corporate leaders.",
