The numbers are even more \ntroublesome when we consider the policing apparatus that fills the nation's carceral facilities. \nBecause of this, the implications for everything else that takes place in that country are vast.\nThis research and writing, intensive course is designed to introduce students to the burgeoning \nfield of carceral studies, focusing largely on the racial, political, economic, and gendered \ndimensions of the carceral state in the United States since its founding to examine how the \nUnited States has become a world leader in the use of incarceration. Course readings this \nsemester cover topics that include: convict labor, criminalization, conquest and imperialism, \nand policing.",
