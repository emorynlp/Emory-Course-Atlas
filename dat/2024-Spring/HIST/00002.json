And why do we often discuss them separately? The course will include readings, discussions, presentations, written assignments, and a research project that engages EmoryÂ¿s work to fulfill its land acknowledgment and honor the enslaved persons whose labor contributed to the life of Emory College and Emory University. By answering these questions, students will get comfortable with and practice the basics of historical analysis, practice interpreting evidence about the past to appreciate the importance of different perspectives on the past and explain the impact of this history today.",
