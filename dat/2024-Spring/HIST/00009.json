The course assumes no prior knowledge of African history, and it does not attempt to cover every aspect of the continent's recent past.  Our focus will be primarily on Africa south of the Sahara Desert.  We will explore themes such as the impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade, European imperialism and conquest, the nature of colonialism, decolonization, economic development, ethnic hatred, and other contemporary challenges facing Africa.",
