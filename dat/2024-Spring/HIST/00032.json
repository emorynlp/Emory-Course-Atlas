From the late nineteenth century to the present, sports reveal important aspects of American history and \nculture. \"In a huge and diverse nation experiencing waves of immigration, struggling with bitter racial divisions, and undergoing a pace of economic change unmatched by any society in the world\", historian Mark Naison penned, \"sports have provided many Americans with a visceral connection to America's lived traditions and cultural values while providing them with a much-needed escape from the \nhardships of their daily lives.\" This course will examine the history of modern sports in the United States with a particular focus on \nrace, gender, and politics. Through lectures, readings, and varying multimedia platforms, we will explore how sports have shaped and reshaped the social, cultural, economic, and political makeup of American society since the nineteenth century.",
