    "class_notes": "This seminar will explore the history of US-Pacific relations through biographies, autobiographies, and historical monographs whose narratives are driven by an identifiable cast of central figures. The focus on ¿lives¿ is not primarily meant to unearth the details of personal lives. Rather, it is meant to inquire how tracing the lives of mobile historical actors challenges conventional periodization and geographical boundaries, and how it raises new questions in historical inquiry. Students will be introduced to various groups of mobile subjects¿missionaries, students, political activists, immigrants, novelists, adoptees, politicians, and health care professionals¿whose transpacific journeys reveal historical connections that have been obscured by nation-bound narratives.\nFor the final project, students will produce a 20-page original research paper centering on a historical figure, or a group of historical figures, whose transpacific life histories can shed light on unknown aspects of the history of the US-Pacific relations.",
