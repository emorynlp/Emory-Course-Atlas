The rising tensions between the two sides and their weighty positions in the world combine to amplify attention to their conflict and contention not just at present but in history. When did China and the West encounter their first round of dispute and what caused the antagonism? How did their relations unfold after the early clashes? Why did their interactions continue despite their disagreements in a wide range of areas during different eras? Compared to conflict, what was the place of peaceful interactivity in the history of China and the West? To what extent did their complex interconnections not only enrich or even change their understanding of each other and themselves but also affect the rest of the world? What are the prospects of Sino-Western relations in the coming decades? This course will address these major questions by examining China-West encounters in politics, economy, and culture since the sixteenth century.",
