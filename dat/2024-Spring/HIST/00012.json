By working closely with primary and secondary sources, we will learn about the history of slavery in North America while exploring how scholars work to reconstruct the lived experiences of enslaved people as well as make sense of their efforts to resist the circumstances of their enslavement. We will pay particular attention to the meaning of resistance in different contexts as well as the moments when enslaved people participated in violent uprisings.",
