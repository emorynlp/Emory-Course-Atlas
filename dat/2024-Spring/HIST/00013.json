    "class_notes": "This discussion-based seminar will focus on the development of nursing from the nineteenth century to the present. We will trace complex processes of the development and administration of Western medicine, usually by working or middle-class white women. The course focuses on development in nursing hailing from Europe and the United States but will critically examine the implementation of this care through an analysis of interactions with colonized persons in Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Southern United States. At the same time, we will trace the theoretical and practical developments of nursing at the imperial centers, including the professionalization of nursing. Students will understand the complex relationship between those who perform care and those who are cared for.\nThis course will engage with primary accounts and memoirs and secondary literature related to nursing and medical history. Students will also analyze depictions of nurses in films screened throughout the course. In doing so, we will grapple with the definition of being a \"nurse\", forged by people practicing nursing and care and outsiders. We will disturb the binary thought that suggests that medicine is theorized and produced by Eurocentric scientists and practiced by nurses and doctors on their patients. Instead, we will come to view the nurse as an intermediary that absorbs techniques from both their training and their patients.",
