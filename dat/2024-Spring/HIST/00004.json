The class will cover topics as diverse as illiberal democracy, wars of conquest, the creation of a petrostate, the taming of the oligarchs, the alliance with religious conservatives, as well as such issues as cultural control and sexual politics. Students will write weekly short reflections and write two short reports on a topic of their choosing in consultation with the professor. Putin has shocked the world with his invasion of Ukraine, find out not only what makes him tick but also how the Soviet Union shaped him and how he shaped Russia. We will be reading portions of Alexievich's Second-Hand Time, Short's Putin, Lacqueur's Putinism, and additional readings that will be provided to students.",
