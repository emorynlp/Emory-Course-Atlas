Protests and uprisings (e.g., against the Vietnam War, repressive governments, racism, and for a new radically democratic society) reached a pinnacle of visibility in a world now interconnected by satellite television broadcasts. By contrast, the years that followed are often described as a time of disillusionment, when the utopian dreams of the young generation degraded into infighting on the Left and even terrorism. This was alongside a general global slide into the economic and political realism of the 1970s, marked by escalating crises in the global economy, energy, and the environment. \nIn this course, we will focus on how German-language and English-language films reflected on the late 1960s as a turning point, both for a rebellious young generation and for a world that was becoming increasingly globally interconnected despite the ongoing Cold War. We will consider how different narratives of 'failed political radicalism' were portrayed from a variety of political and cultural vantage points and explore what these cinematic narratives continue to signify today.",
