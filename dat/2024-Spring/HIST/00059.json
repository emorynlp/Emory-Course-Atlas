The phenomenon has been accompanied by a crisis in housing access, inter-ethnic conflicts, population displacement, environmental refugees, high commodity prices, and the looming threat of famines.  Africa and Latin America are at the center of this phenomenon. But large-scale land grabs are far from being a new phenomenon. This course explores histories of land grabbing tracing them back to European colonialism in these regions, while also focusing on oppositional mobilizations to property concentration. In the process, and by drawing on interdisciplinary tools, we will consider the meaning that land has held beyond economic or market value for various people involved in conflicts over it: land as a source of political sovereignty, as a religious space, as landscape, as a repository of community memory and culture, as a mechanism for political empowerment and for state development.",
