Major themes include Latin America's position in a wider world; class, ethnic, and race relations; state-society relations; the making of regional and national identities.\nClass Notes\n(Latin America stretches across two continents and around the Caribbean Sea, encompassing vast geographical diversity. Divided into many nations and heterogeneous cultures, the region still has some common historical legacies. This class explores both the differences and the similarities. We pay particular attention to ethnic and racial difference within Latin American countries and to persistent patterns of inequality, as well as resistance to oppression. We will situate the region in a global context, primarily through reference to broad economic and political forces. Throughout we will weigh the balance between commonality and difference across the region, aiming at an understanding of how particular national histories fit within a shared region.)\nGrading Structure:\nParticipation: 10%\nShort paper: 15%\nMedium paper: 20%\nQuizzes: 10% X 3\nFinal Exam: 25%",
