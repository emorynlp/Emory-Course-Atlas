The goal of the seminar is to ground students in the basic competencies of historical research, from evaluating existing scholarship to choosing and planning an original thesis project. The seminar also guides participants through the process of designing a research project, step by step. While the work completed in the course is highly individualized, a schedule of readings will introduce participants to the best practices and common challenges of historical research. The seminar will also be a collaborative space in which participants will share their research plans and provide constructive feedback on the work of others.\nOver the course of the semester, students will select a research topic, develop a set of research questions and a research strategy, and identify relevant primary and secondary sources. Each weekly meeting of the course focuses on a component of the research planning process. Weekly engagement in written and spoken form is mandatory for success in the course. By the end of the semester, seminar participants will complete a thesis proposal for submission to the History Department Honors Program.\n\n\n(Permission Required Prior to Enrollment)",
