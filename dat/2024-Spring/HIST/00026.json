At the same time, many young activists and even institutions like the University of California have advocated for \"SWANA\" (Southwest Asian and North African) as an alternate identity option. In a country - if not world - saturated by race, why is there so little consensus about racing the Middle East? This course will explore these debates through ancient sources, medieval texts, nineteenth century eugenics and contemporary DEI efforts, to demonstrate the constructedness of race, as well as its very serious consequences. Rather than rely solely on Western sources, however, the course will also consider multimedia readings emanating from the MENA region, to engage cutting-edge race-making from across the globe.",
