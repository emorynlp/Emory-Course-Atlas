The current conflict which began in 2014 and escalated in 2022'has its roots in both Russian imperial and Soviet territorial expansion. In this seminar we will investigate collectively how to harness decolonizing theory and practice to approach Soviet spatial scholarship in new ways. Through primary texts, scholarly writings, excerpts from works of literature, and period films, we will immerse ourselves in a series of socialist urban environments. Topics include theoretical alternatives to Russo-centrism and center/periphery binaries; planning/architectural case studies in myriad Soviet republics; and current resonances of the expansionist mindset, each of which will elucidate the mechanisms of Soviet territorial control.)",
