    "class_notes": "In this course, you will practice the art of researching and writing history by producing a 20-page major research paper based on original sources. There is no single way to write history; historians take diverse approaches, ask different questions, employ distinct methods, and argue passionately over competing interpretations. This course will provide you with tools to develop your own approach while learning about and adhering to the standards of the historical profession. The theme of the course addresses the process of Spanish and Portuguese colonization that forced Iberian, Indigenous, and African worlds together in Latin America. Spanish exploration and colonialism left an indelible mark on Indigenous states such as the Mexica (Aztec) and Inca empires. From 1521-1821 Spanish missionary officials, priests, and settlers extracted wealth from the Americas, subjected Indigenous people and diverse peoples from the African continent to forced labor regimes, and attempted to claim their souls for the Catholic Church. We will examine how Native and enslaved African peoples adapted, survived, and resisted.",
