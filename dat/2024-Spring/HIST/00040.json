In particular, it considers the legacies of empire on European metropoles, looking at the case of Britain and France, and the international order. We will ask: How did imperial subjects claim rights in European metropole on the eve of decolonization? How did colonial diasporas fight against financial and political exclusion? How did they resist and protested the color bar? And how do European metropoles grapple with the implications of diversity and ethnic minorities still today?",
