Topics include voting rights, immigration policy, nationalism, consumerism, social justice, global citizenship, and the 2024 election cycle.  \n \nThis discussion-based seminar draws upon a variety of source materials including the writings of historians, primary documents, critical essays, video documentaries, music and art of social protest, and contemporary internet resources. \n \nReadings include publications by Linda Kerber, Jill Lepore, Eric Foner, Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cohen, Maxine Hong Kingston, Martin Luther King Jr., David Blight, Iris Marion Young, Juan Gonzalez, Claudio Saunt, Linda Greenhouse, Chantal Mouffe. \n \nStudents are graded on class participation, reading commentaries and occasional quizzes, a semester paper (often drawn from family histories of migration and citizenship) and a final presentation.",
