Since the end of the 19th century, the United States has continuously seen Asian countries in contradictory terms: as economic partners and competitors, as wartime allies and enemies, and as political inspiration and threats. This course will explore these images of Asia to understand the complexity of US-Asian relations. Topics will include US expansion across the Pacific, US wars in Asia, Asian immigration to the US, decolonization and capitalist development, Asian students in the United States, and various relationships between US and Asian political figures. In addition to traditional historical sources, we will use film, photographs, music, and art as a lens through which to interpret multiple dimensions of this history.",
