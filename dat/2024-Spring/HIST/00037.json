What strategies did they develop to cope with legal situations that impacted themselves, their families, and communities? How did they navigate marriage and divorce laws and matters that pertain to family law? Were women engaged in crime? In this class, students explore these questions and assess women's access to the law, their agency through legal processes, and their marginalization. Students will examine these questions as a lens into power relations as well as broader legal, religious, and social developments in this time period.",
