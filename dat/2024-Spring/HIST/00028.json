The USSR suffered far more causalities than any other belligerent nation as Soviet troops stopped the Nazi war machine in epic battles such as Barbarossa, Moscow, Stalingrad, the Siege of Leningrad, Kursk, Operation Bagration and the Battle of Berlin.  But the story of the Great Patriotic War, as it is known by the Russians, is so much broader than the clash of arms.  From the establishment of two violently opposed totalitarian dictatorships to the diplomatic maneuverings of a too crafty Stalin to the shock of invasion and total mobilization of Soviet people, even under a brutal German occupation, this is a story of people.  The course will follow the war through the eyes of simple Soviet soldiers (\"Ivan the Terrible\" to their fascist foes), , brilliant writers and brutalized Gulag prisoners, victims of the holocaust and Red partisans, women snipers and the Generalissimo himself, Iosif Stalin.  The course will focus on the Soviet experience, but of course the Nazi's motivations and actions will be studied, as will be the suspicious and competitive alliance with the Western allies.  The Soviet victory on the Eastern Front was as unexpected as it was earth-shaking and came at an almost incalculable cost in human suffering and a brutally traumatized society.",
