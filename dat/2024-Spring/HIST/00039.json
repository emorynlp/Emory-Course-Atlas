Weekly readings will move us chronologically from the late-nineteenth through early twenty-first century, and will highlight how race, ethnicity, legal status, gender, and class intersect with the class themes.  \nTogether we will learn how migrants have been constructed as subjects historically, discuss borders as projects of nation-building, and engage questions about transnational communities as everyday lived realities and responses to a bordered world. Importantly, the course takes a migrant-centered approach to the study of human mobility and the structures that have aimed to limit, control, and place it under surveillance. Scholarly readings will be paired with diverse primary materials - including films, testimonios, music, art - that depict migrant narratives to help us collectively conceptualize migration to the US historically and in our current moment.",
