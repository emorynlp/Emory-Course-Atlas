Global history focuses on connections and comparisons between societies, starting from the premise that bringing disparate histories and historiographies into closer dialogue sheds light not just on the history of humankind in the aggregate but also on the history of particular regions themselves. The course introduces students to global historyÂ¿s innovative historiography and seeks to help students consider their own research in the light of comparative and global approaches. The course also focuses on teaching and professional development and is intended explicitly to qualify students to obtain positions in a challenging academic job market. Formal training in global history provides a significant benefit because there is an intense and growing demand for instructors who can teach world history, a demand evident in job postings.\nAssignments:\nThere will likely be two main assignments for this course. The first is a research proposal that conceives of a large-scale project (ideally a dissertation project) in global perspective. (Students may substitute a more standard research paper for this assignment if they wish.) The second assignment is a world history syllabus for an introductory world history course at the undergraduate level. Students will also write a book review and make several oral presentations during the course of the semester.",
