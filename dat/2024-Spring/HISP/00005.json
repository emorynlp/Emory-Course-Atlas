We will consider Western philosophical debates about mind, brain, emotion, affect, and body, and the historical value placed on sight, reason, and rationality versus other forms of engagement with the world: smell, taste, belief, and touch. The course is designed to help students appreciate the multidimensionality of the sensorium and learn to analyze sensory hierarchies. We will examine the senses cross-culturally and holistically as a means of communication that operates at cultural, social, and political levels. Students will read a range of social theories, ethnographic texts, and literature, and analyze photography, film, and sound.",
