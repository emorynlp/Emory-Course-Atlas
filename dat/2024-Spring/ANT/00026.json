    "class_notes": "All across the globe democracy is in crisis.  The rise of authoritarianism, fascism, militarism, fundamentalism, communalism, racial intolerance, indifference to the rule of law, and a host of other social forces seem to threaten democracy at its very core, in ways that are wholly unprecedented.  In this course we explore competing explanations regarding why democracy is in crisis.  We also focus on the moral panic that is unfolding around the current crisis, and we investigate what people mean when they say democracy is under threat.  We do so by examining a broad range of contexts from around the world in which democracy has been called into question.  We also explore the increasingly common perception that we are entering a ¿post-democratic age.¿",
