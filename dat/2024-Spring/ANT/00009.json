Who facilitates health and wellness professionally or ritualistically, and how? After examining the concepts of illness and disease in cross-cultural and historical contexts, the course will focus on emergent biomedical practices. We will explore both their strengths and shortcomings and how they are being complemented/supplemented. We will also focus on medical/wellness discourse in Atlanta, and Emory in particular, and our unique role in both local and global health outcomes.",
