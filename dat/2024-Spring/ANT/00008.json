On the one hand, it encompasses anthropological studies of visual culture ¿ for example painting, photography, architecture, museums, the art market, fashion, media and many other topics.    On the other hand, it includes forms of anthropological inquiry pursued through visual media ¿ for example anthropological photography and ethnographic film.
