Answer: they all pursue activities strongly shaped by cultural and social relations regardless of whether they are in highly advanced capitalist or low-income economies. Understanding the ways in which culture and economy interact has been the focus of anthropological studies for more than 100 years and it continues to define some of the discipline's most exciting and relevant work. The purpose of this course is to provide the student with a selected overview of the history, debates, and major topical issues in anthropological studies of economy. It will show how anthropologists study the economic bases of social and cultural life with an emphasis both on agrarian and urban economies. The course is intended to give the student a critical awareness and understanding of the different theoretical and empirical issues that have defined the field of economic anthropology, as well as demonstrate the ways they have enriched understandings of important contemporary issues, including inequality, ethics and social justice, informal sector, digital finance, and globalization. It does not require any prior knowledge of the disciplines of anthropology and economics.",
