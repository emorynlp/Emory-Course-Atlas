How do linguists study language? This course explores the complex nature of human language and introduces students to the scientific study of human language. As we unpack our knowledge of language, we will explore speech sounds (phonetics), sound systems of language (phonology), word and sentence formation (morphology and syntax), how language expresses meaning (semantics), and how context influences the interpretation of meaning (pragmatics). We will also study language in a broader human context, investigating the role of language in defining human society. Additional topics include historical linguistics, language typology, sociolinguistics, and language acquisition.)",
