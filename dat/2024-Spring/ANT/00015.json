    "class_notes": "Human cooperation has been described as a \"spectacular outlier in the animal world, and is considered a crucial component of our unparalleled biological and cultural success. How have we arrived at this particular mode of socialization? What features of our sociality are shared with our primate relatives, and which seem to set humans apart in the animal world? In this course we will evaluate the theories and research that attempt to explain the complexity of human social behaviors with a focus on cooperative and altruistic behaviors, how such behaviors are thought to have evolved, and the methods researchers use to study social behavior. We will examine examples of social phenomena displayed by humans and other animals including: altruism, kin selection, social norms, empathy, cooperative breeding, and between group conflict, that will place human behavior in a comparative and evolutionary context and illustrate the important roles of both biology and cultural learning in our species. To examine this evidence, we will apply an interdisciplinary perspective, synthesizing ideas from anthropology, evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, animal behavior, and psychology to holistically understand cooperation and what it means to be a social primate.",
