Students who took the previous version should not enroll in this course.\n\n\nThis course will provide a critical and rigorous examination of sex, gender, and sexuality by delving into the biological underpinnings and evolutionary roots of primate sexual behavior, and the historical and contemporary approaches to understanding the nuance of human sexuality. This course will be co-taught by two queer anthropologists - who specialize in different aspects of biological anthropology - and will combine expertise on evolution, animal behavior, genetics, and queer history to provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of nature, nurture, and culture in shaping human sexuality. This course will tackle several important questions including: How has heterosexuality become normative and hegemonic? Is homosexual behavior widespread in animals? How has homosexuality evolved? How has biology been misconstrued to perpetuate homophobia and societal gender roles? How has cultural bias shaped our understanding of the complexity of sexual behavior across primates? How can a better understanding of both the biological and cultural underpinnings of sexuality inform health, pleasure, joy, equality, identity, and social justice?",
