    "class_notes": "Primates (including humans) are among the few mammalian taxa that exhibit lengthy periods of prereproductive dependency. During this time, they acquire an astonishing array of skills, including those for finding food, avoiding predators, and, in group-living species, navigating complex situations. This lengthy period of development means there is also a prolonged period to be exposed to sources of variation (maternal, environmental and social) adversity. This graduate seminar will examine the most recent research on sources of variation in primate development and the downstream consequences of that variation in both the short and long term. Major assignments will include class presentations and a research proposal.",
