What kinds of questions do cultural anthropologists ask and how do they go about answering them? How do anthropologists make sense of lived experiences, and what contributions have they made to understanding the diversity of social, political, and economic worlds and to tracing the myriad connections between them? This course explores key concepts, methods, debates, and trajectories in cultural anthropology through our close reading and engagement with anthropological texts, fiction, film (documentary, ethnographic, and feature), podcasts, and other documentary texts. We will engage critically with the history of anthropology to explore ongoing questions about power, subjectivity, identity, and epistemology in anthropological research. Through intensive reading, active participation in class discussions, and weekly written responses, students will analyze anthropological approaches to understanding key concepts such as culture, ethnography, race, ethnicity, gender; environment, health, well-being, migration, violence, and social suffering. Students will gain skills in conducting anthropological fieldwork, including research design, participant-observation, and interviewing.",
