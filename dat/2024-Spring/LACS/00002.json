    "class_notes": "(Same as HIST 285 2)\nSince the turn of the twentieth century, Puerto Rico has occupied a complex political and economic position at the intersection of US and Latin American socio-cultural and political influences, as the island changed its status from that of a Spanish colony into US territory. What has US sovereign control over the island mean for Puerto Ricans politically and economically? How did the status as a US territory emerge legally, and how is it different from that of a US state or from that of a colony? How did Puerto Rico's status as US territory shape its economic and social trajectory? We will pay close attention to questions of public debt, housing access, population control, and food sovereignty. The island has been a laboratory for policies designed to target poverty and social marginalization that resonated globally.  We will develop knowledge about the island directly from archival sources and from online repositories.  \nGrading will consist of class participation (15%), summaries and analyses of primary sources (8 x 500-words; 40%), one presentation (5%), and a final project (30%).",
