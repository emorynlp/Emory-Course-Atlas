This semester, Dr. Tanine Allison will share her ongoing research in progress about computer-generated imagery (CGI) and visual effects sequences in movies. The class will discuss these technologies in relation to issues of performance and identity, especially race and gender. Students will learn how to research topics like performance capture, deepfake/AI imagery, and the visual effects (VFX) industry. They will explore their own research projects in relation to this topic and participate in various kinds of writing and creative scholarship, such as video essays or podcasts.\n\n\nAdditional Prereq of FILM 102, please reach out to Ale Perozo Borges (alejandra.perozo@emory.edu) with your 7-digit ID for a permission number.",
