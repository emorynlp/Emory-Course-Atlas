Using several festivals as case studies, the course will examine some of the deeper, layered issues at stake in studying individual festivals, such as their historical origins, organizational structures, operational mechanisms, and relative positions in national, regional, and global cinema cultures. A central concern of the course will be to help students comprehend the cultural factors and considerations involved in curatorial, programming, and accreditation processes in various festivals. Moreover, we will discuss their important influences on production, circulation, and exhibition within the film industry.",
