    "class_notes": "This seminar discusses the role of awards in popular entertainment. Prizes like the Academy Awards, Emmys, Golden Globes, and Grammys annually reward achievements in the film, television, and music industries. These prizes, however, not only acknowledge accolades for individuals within these fields, the events themselves are cultural spectacles, attracting millions of viewers, showcasing stars in high fashion, and annually facilitating debates on the merits of nominees and winners. This class will examine the human impulse of why we give out prizes and consider the wider cultural significance that these achievements have come to represent. We will examine the role that awards play as a PR fixture, looking at annual awards campaigns, and economic models, considering the movie distribution patterns connected to the yearly movie \"awards season.\" From these contexts, we will explore how those structures often work to facilitate wider exclusionary practices. Examining recent movements like #OscarsSoWhite and Times Up, we will look at how awards spaces both heighten race and gender division while also often serving as a public forum to espouse social activism. Overall, this class strives to articulate how and why awards figure so prominently in our engagement with popular entertainment.",
