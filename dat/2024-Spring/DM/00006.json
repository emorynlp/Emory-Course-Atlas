    "course_description": "In this intensive course-the only course module for track 2 held on the Candler campus-the focus will be on the role of the pastor as teacher, not only in explicitly didactic contexts (e.g., Sunday School, Confirmation, etc.), but also more broadly in terms of the pastor's role as a congregation's 'resident theologian.' Students in the course will consider how learning and formation takes place in myriad contexts, including practices of mission and service, social witness, and worship, and how religious leaders can accompany and facilitate this process.",
