    "course_description": "The 1960s was a decade of turbulence and dramatic social and cultural change.  The war in Vietnam, the civil rights and Black Nationalist movements, the so-called sexual revolution, and the popularization of psychedelic drugs all had considerable impact in shaping the musical culture of the day.  This course considers the music of the period, the relationships between musical forms, and the shifting relationships between the communities associated with them.",
