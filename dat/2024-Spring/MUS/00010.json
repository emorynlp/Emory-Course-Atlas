    "class_notes": "In 2023 Sting visited Bach¿s grave in Germany, the Bach Collegium Japan performed for a full house in Tokyo, and the St. John Passion was heard on tour throughout Malaysia. What do people around the world find so intriguing about Bach¿s music? How is this music received and understood by diverse audiences and cultures? If you¿d like to explore these questions, please join us! ¿Global Bach¿ is arranged as a series of case studies, including substantial units on Bach in Asia, Bach in North America (especially among Indigenous cultures), and Bach in Europe (Germany, the Netherlands, and England). This course is open to all, with no prerequisites. We will listen to and discuss lots of music together, but no prior experience in music is required. Plus, we will have several fantastic guests throughout the semester. Contact Dr. Crist (scrist@emory.edu) if you have any questions. Hope to see you there!\n\n\nMusic majors: This course counts as Category A",
