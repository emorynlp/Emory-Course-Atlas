    "class_notes": "This course explores how music and theatre traditions engage with culture, history, and tradition of performing arts in central Java with a particular focus on the role of the gamelan ensemble.  Students gain first-hand experience in Javanese Wayang theater, a traditional shadow puppet performance in which the gamelan serves as a musical accompanist. This course is designed to not only give performative and practical experience of central Javanese gamelan in the traditional style, but also presents opportunities for students to examine cultural and historical aspects of the shadow puppetry tradition and gamelan music in central Java. We focus specifically on 1) the musical language and structure of central Javanese gamelan music in the context of shadow puppetry performance, 2) the historical tradition and practice of shadow puppetry, and 3) livelihood of traditional performing arts in contemporary sociocultural and religious contexts. Our end-of-semester performance, a wayang performance with a Javanese puppeteer, Darsono Hadiraharjo, is part of the final exam, in which each studentÂ¿s participation is obligatory. Beyond regular rehearsals and the final performance, students will complete reading and writing reading assignment once a week. The class meetings are utilized for hands on practice of music and discussions.\n\n\nMusic Majors: This course counts as Category B",
