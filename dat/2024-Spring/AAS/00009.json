    "class_notes": "(This course focuses on how contemporary Black directors have approached the U.S. South and resisted dominant filmic representations of race in the region. As this course adopts a theorization of the cinematic that focuses on collectively experiencing the moving image, we will explore various forms of media under the rubric of cinema including film, television, and web series. We will approach representation, production history, and audience reception through a critical cultural studies framework that emphasizes analyses of race, class, gender, and sexuality. As a result, this \nclass will historically engage the L.A. Rebellion film movement, the trap subgenre of Southern hip\u0002hop, connections between media industries and the carceral state, Black religion, the Black radical tradition, and other areas)",
