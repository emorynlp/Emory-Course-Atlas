A significant portion of the course will be devoted to Black feminisms of the late 20th century, examining the works of canonical thinkers, including Audre Lorde, bell hooks, and Patricia Hill Collins. We will also explore contemporary scholarship, with particular attention to the work of queer and trans-Black feminists. The course materials will include books, articles, films, podcasts, music videos, and social media. Students will have an opportunity to explore how Black feminism relates to their personal experiences and to develop a project in a medium accessible and shareable with their community, such as a film, a website, or an art project. Some core questions guiding this course include: What is Black feminism and its many iterations? Why are Black feminisms necessary? How are Black feminists changing American politics? This class is a Continuing Communication course.\"",
