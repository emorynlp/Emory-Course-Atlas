Employing art historical methods and a material culture approach, students will be introduced to sacred implements featured in myths and origin stories, tools of divination and birthing/initiation rites, masks of masquerade and carnival traditions, sacred bundles for healing ceremonies, and mortuary arts that honor the ancestors. Ultimately, this course will reveal sacred art objects as a foundational component of African and African Diaspora religions, art history, and material culture traditions.",
