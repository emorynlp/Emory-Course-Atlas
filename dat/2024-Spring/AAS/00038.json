Despite medical advances over the past century, ethnoracial disparities persist. Black, indigenous, Latinx, and people of color in the United States carry an inequitable burden of chronic disease and have higher mortality rates compared to their white counterparts. Since the publication of the Institute of Medicine's report, Unequal Treatment (2003), eliminating health disparities has become a fixture on the 'front-burner' of America's health policy agenda. The persistence of ethnoracial health disparities is concerning as Census projections indicate that Whites will become the demographic minority before mid-century, with Latinx, Asian, and Black populations leading the change in population growth. The resistance of ethnoracial health inequities to current health policy solutions, thus, poses non-ignorable social problems that threaten the economic vitality of our nation and contribute to the propagation of social stratification. As the United States continues to diversify and stratify, it will become increasingly important that we, as a nation, begin to address racial and ethnic inequities in health systematically. This course not only speaks to these underlying conditions and nuances, but also provides tools and mechanisms to consider interdisciplinary responses to mitigating ethnoracial inequities in health and healthcare outcomes.",
