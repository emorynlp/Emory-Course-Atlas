    "class_notes": "This course surveys the theoretical contributions of black scholars in the US and the African Diaspora. We will explore foundational texts concerning the Black Radical Tradition, Black Feminisms, and Black Literary and Cultural Studies. We will consider how social constructions of the human have alienated blackness, how blackness is positioned within capitalist systems, how blackness intersects with gender and sexuality, and ongoing social and political (re)productions of blackness. We will interrogate how these factors have shaped colonial legacies and state violence since the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Collectively, we will build a framework toward understanding the persistence of violence, trauma, and dispossession in the lives of African Diasporic peoples while also highlighting Black people's resistance, refusal, and reimagining over the last four centuries. We will also consider disciplinary differences and methodological approaches to the investigation and exploration of freedom and liberation in the lives of black peoples.",
