This course aims to create an interdisciplinary feminist space for examining and responding to how visual culture frames definitions/representations of identities and knowledge production. We will explore the power of visuality from the early photographs of enslaved African Americans to contemporary digital culture and social media documenting and perhaps perpetrating racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. \n \nWe will engage compelling questions such as, how does visual culture advance or hinder Black freedom? How is the history of photography linked to the history of race and gender-based oppression? Does photographing violence introduce a new layer of violence? Can Black joy be captured on film? \n \nAuthors include Kimberly Juanita Brown, Tina Campt, Jasmine Cobb, Aston Gonzalez, Mark Sealy, JoAnn Morgan, C. Riley Snorton, and Deborah Willis.",
