How does exclusion cement projects of nation-building and displacement of various fears and concerns? How does whiteness become a form of property? How do race and gender function in relation to each other? How do we recognize a good Muslim? A bad Arab? A (bad) immigrant v. a cosmopolitan citizen? Do persons make decisions about their identities or are they ?produced? in ways beyond their control? Can one?s racial, ethnic, gendered self-recognition be publicized in ways that they like, or will that identity necessarily be misrecognized and reappropriated? Is Blackness different from the production of other kinds of racial identities? In this course, we will explore a range of philosophical texts and legal and historical documents to understand the ways in which notions of exclusion (including gender and race, but also more abstract ways) function the creation of new imaginaries of homeland in the aftermath of empire. Readings will include works by Critical Race Theorists/Feminists, Black Feminist Theorists, and Transnational, Post-colonial, and Indigenous Studies feminist scholars.",
