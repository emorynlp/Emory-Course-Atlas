    "course_description": "This course is designed to provide doctoral students with theoretical and applied knowledge of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). Foundational knowledge of HLM is taught by extending knowledge of regression analysis to designs involving a nested data structure. This course also includes instruction in programming in and interpretation of the output for computer software for conducting HLM. Furthermore, advanced topics such as HLM for ordinal outcome variables and dyadic data will be presented.",
