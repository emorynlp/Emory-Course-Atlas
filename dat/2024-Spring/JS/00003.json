Using the methods of historical criticism, we will study the biblical texts (in English translation) in their original ancient Near Eastern context(s), with a focus on the major events that impacted ancient Israel and shaped its identity. At the same time, we will read and appreciate biblical texts as artful works of ancient literature in their own right. We will also attend to the status of the Hebrew Bible as a sacred text for Jewish and Christian communities, but no particular religious identity is assumed or required in this course. In fact, no prior experience with the Hebrew Bible, or biblical studies in general, is required. What is required is an interest in the Bible, and a willingness to engage with new and even uncomfortable ways of reading it.",
