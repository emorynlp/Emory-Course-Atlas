    "course_description": "Over the past decade, a professional sports team's decision processes have been transformed from being based mainly on intuition and experience, to being based on copious amounts of data and sophisticated statistical models; this trend has even been highlighted in popular culture through the bestselling book and blockbuster movie, \"Moneybal\". In this course, we will focus on the use of analytics and data for improving human capital related decisions in the context of both sports and non-sports. The core of the class will focus on developing data management and statistical skills.",
