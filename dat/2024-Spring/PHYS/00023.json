    "course_description": "The goal of the course will be to introduce the scientific method, in the context of classical mechanics and electromagnetism. Instead of accepting Newton's laws, special relativity or Maxwell's equations as the generalizations of empirical observations, you will understand how these laws naturally emerge as a consequence of the general symmetries of space-time. The course will also identify connections between classical dynamics and other areas of physics. Our intent is to provide you with the methodological ammunition for developing theories and models in your graduate research and beyond.",
