In a solemn ceremony, the King took his oath in the name of God Almighty, while the majority of Parliament members pledged their allegiance similarly. Amidst the distinguished guests, Sheikha Moza of Qatar graced the occasion in a stunning black dress and elegant headgear, making no overt reference to Islam. Meanwhile, the \"Queen\" of Morocco, Lalla Selma, attracted attention for her Rita Hayworth-like un-Islamic appearance. The Dutch newspapers couldn't help but feature her \"uncovered red hair\" and her \"beautiful dark green kaftan\" on their front pages.\nOur journey continues to Belgium, where Islam received official recognition as a state religion in the early 1970s. This acknowledgment led to the integration of Islamic teachings into public school curricula. The Belgian Minister of Education expressed concern on TV about young Muslim students who left for Syria while still subject to compulsory education. Newspapers in French, Belgian, and Dutch languages echoed these worries, as politicians and civil organizations grappled with the increasing numbers of young Europeans of Islamic descent joining the conflict in Syria. Measures discussed included the potential revocation of Belgian citizenship for recruits.)",
