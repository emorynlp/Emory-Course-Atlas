In this course, we explore classic theories and historical cases of rites of passage from a variety of cultural settings, with special attention to the African continent. We also consider what is gained and lost with processes of modernization and globalization that have radically altered, if not entirely eradicated, many long-standing rituals and ceremonies. Students will be invited to reflect on their own experiences of transition and transformation, and to imaginatively design rites of passage relevant and responsive to the needs of their own communities and their own generation.",
