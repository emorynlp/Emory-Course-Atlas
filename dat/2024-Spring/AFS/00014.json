A central issue will be understanding the historical development of capitalism. We will look at topics such as world trade, the emergence of monocrop economies such as sugar and cotton, the industrial revolution, drought and imperialism, and patterns of environmental change in the twentieth century.  The course ends with the present, especially the debates on and around climate change and neo-liberalism (the idea of reducing governmental intervention and allowing the market to operate freely).",
