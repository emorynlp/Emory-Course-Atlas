What is the ethical significance of silence? And how do sounds shape our selves, our communities, and our worlds? In this course, students will approach the ethics and philosophy of sound as a fecund site of social and political inquiry. Working between canonical figures and contemporary interventions, students will be challenged to critically engage with a variety of media, from philosophical articles to Podcast episodes. From protest anthems to advanced military technologies, students will learn to question what sound is, what it means, and why it matters for ethical deliberation.",
