The focus will be on the main philosophical innovations of the Indian Buddhist tradition, starting with the earliest dialogues and moving through the classical developments of the Abhidharma, Madhyamaka, and Yog¿c¿ra streams. Some of the topics to be covered include the Buddha's diagnosis of the human condition and its causes; suffering and freedom from suffering; personal identity in the absence of an enduring self; emptiness or the absence of inherent existence in things; critique of the body-mind distinction; the theory of two truths, conventional and ultimate, and the implications for knowledge; inferential reasoning in the absence of essential natures; the status of language and the possibility of a non-conceptual perceptual knowledge; ethical cultivation without a self; altruism as enlightened self-interest; and the theory and practice of meditation. As a discussion-based seminar, the course depends on close reading of primary texts, active participation, and regular writing. Writing assignments will include short discussion posts and journal entries. There will also be a take-home midterm and a take-home final exam.",
