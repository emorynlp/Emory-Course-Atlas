    "course_description": "The Old Testament is replete with images about God and Israel, sin and salvation, exile and restoration. Whether in the form of metaphors or other figurative language, these expressions have the power to stir our theological imagination and to prompt us to understand God, the world, and ourselves in profoundly new ways. Yet, interpreting this language is not easy. For instance, understanding what the prophet Amos means when he says \"the LORD roars from Zion\" (1:2) not only demands a close analysis of the literary and rhetorical settings of the book of Amos but also awareness of the conceptual background¿both verbal and visual¿that informs how and why this imagery is used in the first place. Complicating matters further are the numerous hermeneutical considerations that come to bear on how, or even if, this imagery should be appropriated for Christian theology and the various ministries of the church today.",
