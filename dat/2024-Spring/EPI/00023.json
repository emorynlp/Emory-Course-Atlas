This course will provide students with a conceptual overview of structural determinants of health, including an understanding of how structural factors contribute to health inequalities. Through domestic and international case studies of structural interventions in resource-poor settings, students will learn about study designs and analytic methods to assess the impact of structural interventions on health. Students should expect to gain knowledge about how structural factors affect many aspects of health and methodological skills in assessing the effectiveness of structural interventions. Prerequisites are: EPI 530 and BIOS 500.",
