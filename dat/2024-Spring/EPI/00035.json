This topic differs from more traditional introductory or intermediate level machine learning courses, which are often focused specifically on predictive analytics. In this course, we will cover why inference (statistical and causal) is a challenge when machine learning methods are used to estimate causal effects and obtain valid inference statistics.\nEPI PHD students only; Doctoral students from other programs with instructor permission.\nThis course will meet Monday, 1/8 through Friday, 1/12. 8:30AM-5:30PM.",
