Students are presented a problem or research question from a public health organization along with available data that can be used to address the question(s) at hand. The class will be divided into groups of five, with each group working on a distinct, but related question that is relevant for the partnering organization. Students conduct background research to understand the scope and context of the question(s) and conduct relevant analyses. The research findings are presented in a variety of formats. Throughout this course, students continue to develop their professional skills through effective teamwork, giving and receiving feedback, and journal article discussions.",
