MSPH and PhD students only.\nThis course builds on the fundamental epidemiologic concepts introduced in EPI 530: Epidemiologic Methods I. Specifically, causality, bias (including confounding, information bias, and selection bias), and concepts of mediation and interaction will be revisited in greater depth. By the end of the course, students will be able to do the following: formulate research questions to evaluate causality; evaluate the strengths and limitations of epidemiologic studies; assess how the strengths and limitations of a study affect interpretation of study results; utilize epidemiologic methods to address confounding; identify epidemiologic methods to address selection bias and information bias; and calculate measures to assess interaction.",
