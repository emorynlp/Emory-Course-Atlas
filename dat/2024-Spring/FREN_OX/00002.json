The course will have three primary subject centers: current events in the French and Francophone world, careful reading of short literary texts, and a culminating unit on the French Revolution. All three will provide the impetus for discussions, presentations, and writing assignments formal and informal. \nPrerequisites: French 201, placement recommendation, or instructor permission. \nAssessment : Engaged participation, daily practice exercises, varied short writing assignments, four unit tests, three graded one-on-one conversations.",
