With the assistance of the instructor, your advisor, and your peers, you will identify a research question that could develop into a viable second year paper.  Through staged assignments throughout the semester, you will design a study to answer your research question, execute the study by collecting pilot data or downloading secondary data, and analyze your results.  You will present these results in an empirical paper at the end of the semester.  As a requirement for our class, you must become certified in research with human subjects by taking the on-line CITI course.  (You can use a valid CITI certificate from another institution).",
