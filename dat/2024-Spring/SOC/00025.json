How might we expand our understanding of violence and its consequences for health using global, comparative/historical, and sociological perspectives?\n\n\nThis course will begin with perspectives on framing violence to ask, ¿What is violence?¿. We will then apply these perspectives to unpacking the effects of different forms of violence on health in global and local settings. We will conclude by evaluating how societies and communities have responded to mitigating the health consequences of violence. Evaluations will include weekly attendance and reflections, two exams (midterm and final), and four one-time assessments building towards a final project.",
