Classical theorists such as Ã‰mile Durkheim and Max Weber pioneered the sociological study of law, and contemporary researchers continue to examine law's deep connection to both consensus and conflict in society. In this course we'll see how the sociology of law is situated within a larger interdisciplinary field of legal scholarship that includes the work of philosophers, historians, anthropologists, economists, and others. We will also explore the practical relevance of the sociology of law for legal reformers seeking to correct perceived flaws in the system. Other topics will include the evolutionary origins of morality; formal versus informal social control; the history and culture of the police; the socialization of law school students; and current legal controversies regarding the insanity defense, drug use, gun control, campus speech codes, religious expression, and capital punishment.",
