    "class_notes": "In this course we will examine health, illness, and health care institutions as social phenomena, in four parts that move from the macro-social to the micro-social, and across cultures. In Part I we will learn about population trends in health and the aging of our global society, as well as the social forces that play a determining role. In Part II we will examine and compare health care institutions in the US and several industrialized countries, with special attention to the Affordable Care Act, which went fully into effect in January 2014. In Part III we will study the social relationships and roles of health care providers and patients. Finally, in Part IV we take up issues of the experience of illness and the role that health plays in individual identity.\n\n\nThe following books are available at the Emory College Bookstore.
