Class sessions will involve a combination of hands-on activities, discussions, guest presentations and practice teaching sessions. We will approach teaching as a collective endeavor; students will be responsible for: leading discussion of the readings and topics; providing feedback on each other's course materials; preparing for each other's practice-teaching session and sharing information and experiences about teaching. Throughout the course, we will cultivate our individual pedagogical approaches and modes of teaching, linking these themes to practical nuts and bolts of teaching. Flexibility is built into the syllabus; we may adapt the syllabus to accommodate your specific interests, needs and goals as they emerge. By the end of the class, you will have created a syllabus and supporting materials (assignments, exams, projects, etc.) for an undergraduate sociology course.",
