We will discuss how and why sociologists study emotion, and what its implications are in the real world. This includes exploring how feelings and emotions can be understood in many different ways: as universal and natural, as well as socially constructed and culturally determined. After taking this course, students will be able to articulate multiple perspectives of how sociologists think about and study emotion. Moreover, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that emotions are understood culturally and internally",
