Elevated rates of mortality experienced by Black families and communities consequently lead to mass bereavement. These deaths not only immediately disrupt lives as individuals wade through grief and mourning but can set off a ripple of cascading consequences in the lives of the bereaved. In this course, we will examine the ripple or \"spillover\" effects of Black-White disparities in mortality by considering intergenerational consequences of deaths for survivors' health and socioeconomic wellbeing.\n\n\nTopic:  The Loved Ones Left Behind: Racial Inequities in Bereavement and Loss",
