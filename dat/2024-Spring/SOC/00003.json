The focus of the course is on how groups ranging from friendship circles to ethnic groups affect the life of an individual and how the individual affects the group. The course examines the reciprocal relationship between individual-level and group-level phenomena and how inequalities emerging in interactions have consequences for larger groups and organizations. The course has three parts: (1) the self and identity, (2) cognition, perception, and emotions, and (3) group processes.",
