    "course_description": "The course (1) provides students with grounding in media sociology and (2) prepares students for doing their own media research. To do so, we touch upon the following themes: (a) We examine how various media industries are organized and how such organization is sometimes transformed by regulation, competition, and/or technology. This examination includes both \"old\" (e.g., film) and \"new\" media (e.g., social media, streaming video on demand). (b) We focus on the careers of workers within media industries, connecting the constraints of their work environments to the type of content the produce. (c) We inspect media content and investigate factors that promote stability, change, and diversity - including online content. (c) We address the consumers of mass media products and inspect how they utilize and are shaped by media content, as well as how they are also sometimes the producers of content. This course is thus crucial.",
