    "class_notes": "(Same as ENG 789 6, FREN 780 3)\nHistory has put on trial a series of creative thinkers. At the dawn of philosophy, Socrates drinks the cup of poison to which he is condemned by the Athenians for his influential teaching, charged with atheism, and corruption of the youth. Centuries later, in modernity, similarly influential (similarly charismatic and ironically subversive) Oscar Wilde is condemned by the English for his homosexuality, as well as for his provocative artistic style. In France, the most outstanding writers--Flaubert and Baudelaire-- are both indicted as criminals for their first (shockingly innovative) literary works; Emile Zola is condemned for defending a Jew against the state which has convicted him, and flees from France to England to escape imprisonment.\n\n\nHowever different, all these accused have come to stand for something greater than themselves: something that was symbolized -- and challenged - by their trials. Through the examination of a series of historical and literary legal dramas, this course will ask: Why are literary writers, artists and philosophers, repetitively put on trial, and how in turn do they put on trial culture and society? What is the role of art and literature as (willing or unwilling) legal players, and as political actors in the struggles over ethics, and the struggles over meaning?\n\n\nTEXTS selected among: Plato's Dialogues; Moli√®re's plays; Shakespeare's plays; Oscar Wilde (Plays, Autobiography, Critical writings); Gustave Flaubert (novels,Tales, letters); Charles Baudelaire (poems, criticism, theory of art); Emile Zola (political writings); Bertolt Brecht (plays); \nSpinoza (Ethics); Sigmund Freud (Psychoanalytic Writings); Jacques Lacan (psychoanalytic seminars); E.

Forster (novel); Virginia Woolf (novel); Franz Kafka (short stories, parables\n\n\nRegular attendance; Two short papers distributed throughout the course of the semester; Very brief oral presentations; Intensive weekly reading (weekly one-page reading reports) and active preparation of texts for class discussion; ongoing participation.\n\n\nAdvanced Undergraduates (recommended by their teachers) may be able to take the course (by permission).",
