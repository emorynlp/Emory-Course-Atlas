In addition to close readings of the Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles, Marguerite de Navarre, Catherine Bernard, Madame de Lafayette, Madame D'Aulnoy, D¿Aulnoy, and Charles Perrault, the seminar will also seek to reconnect early-modern storytelling practices with the work of contemporary artists and activists engaged in redefining the good life. Taught in French and English.",
