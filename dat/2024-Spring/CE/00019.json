    "course_description": "Internships are a student initiated practical experience for which the student gains academic credit at Candler. Students can intern with a church, an agency, or with an existing internship program. Students must have a Candler faculty member and an approved placement supervisor identified to direct the internship. Internships provide students with an opportunity to tailor their course of study by meeting specific ministry-learning goals they have, to enrich and/or complement their courses, to provide more depth to a particular aspect of ministry, or greater exposure to a broader range of ministry. It also can be an important avenue for discernment of the student's professional ministry and calling. Candler also offers a number of summer internships that feature paid positions in congregations. Designed to foster more intensive formation and proficiency in the practice of ministry, these internships include online mentoring and an online reflection group, so students get the maximum benefit from this immersion experience.",
