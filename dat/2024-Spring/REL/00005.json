It meets for two synchronous 75-minute sessions per week on MW.\nThis course satisfies the Religion major requirement: - Theme, Region.\nAt the most fundamental level, I am hoping in this class you will learn something about how religious life and psychoactive substances are surprisingly intertwined, through history and across cultures, and most especially across the contemporary American religious landscape. At a more complex level, another goal is to be sure you leave the course more confused about American religious identities than when you entered, but with a better understanding of the politics and indeterminacies of the two key terms we will focus on throughout: \"religion\" and \"drugs.\"",
