    "class_notes": "This course satisfies the Religion major requirement:- Theme.\nOver the last decade, scholars of politics, international relations, and foreign diplomacy have begun to re-assess the perceived role of religion in politics. As the secularization thesis - which we will discuss in class - became increasingly untenable, (some/many) scholars of politics realized they needed a more sophisticated understanding of religion. At the same time, scholars of religion became increasingly interested in new places, spaces, and contexts in which religion is imagined, articulated, practiced, and contested, and how that might shed light on larger issues of power and politics beyond orthodoxy and ideology. In this course, we will examine the intellectual convergence of scholarship about religion and world affairs. Our primary book \"Rethinking Religion and World Affairs\" will provide the framework and trajectory for our course, but each student will also contribute and build on their own areas of interests.",
