    "class_notes": "This course satisfies the Religion major requirement: - Theme. \nWhen people refer to the lyrics of a favorite songwriter as \"gospel,\" when Yeats counts Shelley's Prometheus Unbound as among the sacred books of the world, or when Stanley Cavell argues that in Walden Thoreau was writing a scripture for America, scripture isn't being invoked in its strict religious sense. Rather, it is being understood more broadly as a text worthy of our trust, and which demands a certain kind of attention. In this course, we will investigate just what kind of attention this is-what kind of reading scripture inspires-by looking at a number of instances of trustful reading. The examples we shall examine represent a range of religious and literary traditions, and include Kierkegaard's reading of the story of Abraham and Isaac, Ramanuja's reading of Chandogya Upanishad 6, and Cavell's reading of King Lear. As we will discover, our readers don't engage in many of the activities often associated with sophisticated literary analysis, such as unmasking hidden agendas or exposing tensions and contradictions. Nonetheless, their readings are no less thoughtful for being unskeptical, and they will challenge our sense of what close reading looks like. Throughout the course, students will be invited to reflect on which texts they have learned to trust and, in their final papers, to formulate their own affirmative readings of these.",
