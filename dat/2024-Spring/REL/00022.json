Surrogacy, IVF and the potential for cloning are just a few of the technologies that have raised important questions about how human beings reproduce as well as the costs and responsibilities associated with any creation of new life. Who should be considered the mother of a child born through gestational surrogacy? Is reproductive cloning a potentially exciting new technology or a nightmarish assault on what it means to be human? How do different cultures and religious traditions grapple with these issues in distinctive ways? We use tools from ethnography and medical anthropology, comparative religions, and bioethics discourse to find out.",
