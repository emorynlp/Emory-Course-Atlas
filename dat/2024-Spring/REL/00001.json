Subtitled \"People and Their Gods,\" the course gives special attention to cultural phenomena identified with the category of \"religion.\" Drawing on a range of evidence, both material and literary, we will explore how ancient Mediterranean people understood and interpreted stories about gods and other powerful beings (\"myths\"); polytheism and monotheism; veneration of images (\"idolatry\"); tradition and innovation in religious beliefs and practices; the significance of sacrifice (including human sacrifice); how Jews and Christians viewed so-called \"pagans\" and how \"pagans\" viewed Jews and Christians; the ancient Mediterranean roots and sources of present-day religious traditions.)",
