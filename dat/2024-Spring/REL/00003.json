How can we build lives that are meaningful to us -- and that produce positive effects for others?  These are some of the biggest questions we can ask as human beings, and they are not idle ones.  We show our answers to these questions in how we live.  \nWe will discuss the possible meanings of life in conversation with the thinkers and artists we will read together and in our conversations with each other.  On the way, we will consider situations and choices we all encounter: our educational choices, our choice of career (including the practice of medicine, among other professions), personal relationships, and how we navigate life stages.  We will discuss the things we enjoy, and the things we donÂ¿t, in our lives.  Some of our class texts will be philosophical, some literary, some historical, some filmic.\n\n\nThis is a class that runs on reading and discussion.  Attendance and participation are essential to our learning goals, as we build the conversation together every day and learn from each other.  Students will also complete 5 short writing assignments for the class and two presentations.\nTexts include, tentatively, \nMaxine Greene, \"Wide-Awakeness and the Moral Life\"- essay\nPlato's Apology of Socrates\nAristotle, Nicomachean Ethics (excerpts)\nSimone Weil, \"On the Right Use of School Studies with a View to the Love of God\"William Deresiewicz, \"What is College For?\"Essays by Toni Morrison, Ann Patchett, Thomas Merton, Atul Gawande, Molly Worthen, among others.\nDag Hammarskjold, Markings (excerpts)\nCheryl Strayed, Tiny Beautiful Things \nWit by Margaret Edson (HBO, film)",
