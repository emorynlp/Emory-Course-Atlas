Attention will be given to the integration of students' religious study with future careers. Students will meet with a few Religion majors now working in Atlanta and develop a portfolio of their work related to religion. One part of the portfolio will be a written research project, but the portfolio can also include other styles of work. Past portfolios have included podcasts, paintings, and stand-up routines.",
