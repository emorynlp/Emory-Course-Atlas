    "class_notes": "This course satisfies the Religion major requirement: - Theme. \nThis course concerns the human body in three religious traditions: Buddhism, Taoism, and Christianity. Topics under each of these tradition will include sex, healing, and death, and under one or more of these traditions may cover: diet, dieting, toilet hygiene, ritual, gender, monastic discipline, exercise, and meditation. The human body is a religious problem, but also a solution. Some of our theoretical questions are: How do religions try to solve the body's problems in order to get on with the more important business of salvation (of the mind or soul)? Or, might salvation lie in the body itself? Is the body an enemy or a friend to salvation? What role does sexual desire play, for example, in the various projects of salvation, liberation, or enlightenment? How is the body used as a measure of spiritual condition? What are the relations of the body and truth?",
    "course_description": "An exploration of the body and bodily experience in selected religious traditions. Topics may include: ritual, asceticism, monasticism, healing, gender, sex, diet, birth, and death.",
