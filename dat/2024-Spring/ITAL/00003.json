ITAL 202 Intermediate Italian II Content: This intermediate ITAL 202 course is for students who have already completed ITAL201 or an equivalent of it. ITAL202 is designed to help students build communication skills in Italian. We emphasize all four language skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing as well as cross-cultural competency. By the end of the semester, students should be able to (a) interact successfully in Italian, (b) understand a majority of what they hear and read in Italian, and (c) express themselves clearly in spoken and written Italian.",
