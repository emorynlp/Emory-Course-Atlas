The term Baroque is often defined as an oddly shaped pearl that appears to want to blow apartÂ¿exaggerated, bizarre, decadent, irregular, sometimes monstrous. The concept of the marvelous, a phenomenon adopted during the Baroque to arouse wonder through extravagant, extended metaphors, startling word plays, and original myths, was often utilized by preachers, artists, museum curators, orators, authors, and scientists to attract followers. Guided by critical readings, we will examine objects created by a baroque sensibility during the era of telescopes, microscopes, museums, carnival, an infinite universe, a solar revival, a same sex model, and sculptures and paintings that extend into the infinite. We will also reflect on modern society and our own identities and cultures to see how the Baroque sensibility has infiltrated into our own consciousness in subtle yet powerful ways.",
