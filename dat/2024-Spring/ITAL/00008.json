Besides reading excerpts from Dante's classic sources like Virgil and Ovid, we will look at echoes of the Commedia in modern literature and culture, exploring, in particular, the way Inferno has been used to think and represent the modern metropolis and the expansion of capitalist society. While studying Dante's worldview and the geographical construction of a mental space, we will follow the translation of his work in different media and genres in contemporary receptions, from theater to the novel. \nAll class discussions and readings will be in English, knowledge of Italian is not required.",
