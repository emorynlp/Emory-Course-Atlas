We will most likely be reading Enemies and Neighbors: Arabs and Jews in Palestine and Israel, 1917-2017 by journalist Ian Black. We might also have guest speakers. This reading club is aimed at undergraduates of all years. There will be no assignments beyond doing the reading and contributing to discussions.  We look forward to learning together.
