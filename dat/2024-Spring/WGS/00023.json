We will engage current debates in pedagogical research and commentary (via the Chronicle of Higher Education), we will create a toolkit of materials, activities and techniques for teaching, and we might occasionally invite a guest speaker to the class. Attention will be paid through the semester to the challenges and difficulties that arise in the classroom and we will discuss strategies for meeting those challenges. Flexibility is built into the syllabus, we can adapt the syllabus to accommodate your interests, needs and goals as they emerge. \nWe will read important pedagogical theories to provide conceptual frameworks for your teaching. You will produce a statement of teaching philosophy and a syllabus and supporting materials (assignments, exams, projects etc.) for WGS200.",
