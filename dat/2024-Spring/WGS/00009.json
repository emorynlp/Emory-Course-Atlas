This course will explore central aspects of the American legal system from a queer and feminist perspective, and ask how we might approach questions of gender, race, sexuality, and ability in relation to justice. We will look both at critical scholarship and at the current docket of US Supreme Court and Circuit Court legal cases as we follow key debates in queer and feminist legal theory. We will also develop a set of methodological tools to help us better understand the operation of our systems of governance, as well as the role of law and policy in maintaining and/or challenging social hierarchies. Topics will include questions of equality, difference, subordination, bodily autonomy, racial justice, transgender rights, employment, violence, citizenship, family, & reproductive freedom.",
