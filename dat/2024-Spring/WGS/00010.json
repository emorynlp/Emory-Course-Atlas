    "class_notes": "The `scienceÂ¿ of gender slowly and unevenly moves from the lab to the clinic. Healthcare access, effective diagnosis, and treatment depend on clinicians, use of masculinity, femininity, and forms of non-binary gender identity. This class examines the experiences of patients as they navigate illness and health. By studying how healthcare providers and researchers seek to understand gender and deploy gender identity in delivering care, students explore the life-and-death stakes of cultural investments in gender and health. Readings and course material will juxtapose health systems across a range of historical periods and geographic settings so that students may compare and contrast gender normalization from one setting to the next.",
