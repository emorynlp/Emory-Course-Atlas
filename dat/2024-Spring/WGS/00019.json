Ethnography is a fieldwork-based methodology embedded in the discipline of anthropology, though it has taken on a transdisciplinary character and has been lauded by feminist scholars. This course begins by thinking through the theoretical, conceptual, and ethical implications of constituting an ethnographic tradition that is either queer, feminist, or both. This course asks how queer and feminist theory and epistemology are embodied in ethnographic work. We will examine how ethnographic writing positions the queer, trans, and/or feminist subject within its texts in relation to the world, and to its readership. We will specifically interrogate how queer and feminist ethnographies have sought to engage what it means to be human through their attention to these categories.",
