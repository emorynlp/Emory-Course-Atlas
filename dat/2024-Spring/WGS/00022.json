At its core are the political struggles, theoretical interventions, and worldmaking possibilities that Black feminists have created in and for a variety of global contexts, particularly in the Global South. Focusing on the histories and legacies of colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade, this course will examine the ways in which feminist and queer thinkers of African descent have theorized, imagined, and innovated beyond the violent structures of western modernity. In so doing, the course will expand the contours of how we understand Black feminism, paying particular attention to the ways in which transnational, diasporic, and decolonial frameworks have produced critical, but often-understudied genealogies of Black feminist thought. Central to this polyglot field of study will be the study of feminist knowledge-making in a variety of global contexts; queer and trans theorizations of Black life; Black womens histories of radicalism and internationalism; and transnational activist critiques of gendered, racial, and sexual violence.",
