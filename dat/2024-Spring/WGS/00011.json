Although systems of transphobia, homophobia, and heterosexism harmed and continues to harm Black queer and trans communities, scholars and cultural workers have created artwork despite its confines. They have made films, written memoirs, and theorized the complex relationship between race, class, gender, and sexuality in relation to the American nation-state. This course will first examine iterations of racially motivated homophobia and transphobia in institutions of the state such as prisons and housing authority, then turn to acts of resistance and cultural intervention by activists, scholars, and cultural workers such as Tourmaline, Stacy Ann Chinn, E. Patrick Johnson, and Marlon Riggs.",
