We will analyze sexual violence in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa, the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and civil war in Liberia in the 1990s and early 2000s. We will learn about and assess the efforts such as truth and reconciliation commissions that were put in place to try and bring resolution to these divided societies. Sexual violence and gender-discrimination both in conflict and after make it crucial that we reevaluate how we understand and analyze conflict, transitional justice, and the meanings of peace.)",
