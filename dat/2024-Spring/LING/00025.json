    "class_notes": "We'll discuss short works of fiction that deal with some of the big questions in linguistics: What makes language unique? What makes it not so unique? What does language tell us about the human mind? What is its role in the human experience? Sci-fi helps us imagine possibilities that might not otherwise occur to us, adding nuance to our thinking on these big questions.\nEach week there will be an assigned short story, novella, novel excerpt or film to read or watch ahead of time. Grading will be based on participation (including some discussion-leading), weekly informal reading responses or quizzes, and a final interview/conversation about a selected novel.  All required readings will be made available for free.\n\n\nPre- or co-requisite: at least one other LING course, or permission of instructor. Students who have already taken this class aren't eligible to enroll for credit, but may be allowed to audit (email Dr. Pak about this).",
