    "class_notes": "This course presents a linguistic view of the history, society, and culture of the United States. It discusses the many languages and forms of language that have been used in this country over its history, including standard and nonstandard forms of English, different social and geographical dialects, African American English, creoles, Native American languages, and immigrant languages from Asia and Europe. Students examine the inherent diversity of these communicative systems both as a form of cultural enrichment and as the basis for socio-political conflict, and also investigate possible solutions to these problems through class discussion and debate. In addition, students study the universal phenomenon of language change and explore how it affects understanding of language behavior.\n\n\nLING 101 is required for the Linguistics, Psychology/Linguistics, and Spanish/Linguistics majors, and the QSS major w/ Linguistics concentration. Linguistics minors must take LING 101 or 401W.",
