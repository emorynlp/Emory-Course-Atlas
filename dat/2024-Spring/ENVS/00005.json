Covering 2/3 of the Earth¿s surface and controlling the energy balance of the planet, clouds are the major source of uncertainty in climate predictions. In this class, through lectures, discussions and simple experiments, students will learn about the physical mechanisms governing cloud formation, existence and dissipation. We will also explore the role of clouds in the Earth¿s climate system, as well as the human attempts to control the weather and climate by cloud modification.",
