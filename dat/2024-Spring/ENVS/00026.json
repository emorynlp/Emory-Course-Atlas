It focuses on the systemic and historical roots of environmental injustices both within America and on a global scale. We will pay specific attention to injustices related to toxic waste, clean water access, tree canopy distribution, housing, climate change, renewable energy, food, occupational hazards, and health outcomes. We will examine how these inequities disproportionately affect Blacks, Indigenous, immigrants, and communities of color. We will also examine how social movements have responded to these injustices, including how they challenge systems and structures that perpetuate environmental racism and socio-economic inequalities. Students will learn about modern methods and tools for measuring environmental injustices as well as strategies, policies, and practical solutions for promoting environmental justice in different geographical and ecological contexts.",
