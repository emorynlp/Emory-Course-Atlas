    "course_description": "This course provides an overview of theories, case studies, and social interventions related to gender and global health, with a focus on poor settings. Students are exposed to major theories in the social sciences and public health that have advanced an understanding of the institutional and ideological bases of gender inequities and of the power dynamics within couples and families that influence women's and men's health and wellbeing in these settings. The theoretical and empirical underpinnings of existing social policies and interventions intended to empower women in resource-poor countries are stressed, and case studies of the health-related consequences of these policies and interventions are discussed. By the end of the course, students will have developed the ability to evaluate critically and to identify the relationships between theory, evidence, and social interventions related to gender and health in poor settings. This course is offered on alternate spring semesters.",
