    "class_notes": "Paul Farmer denotes: \"Social factors including gender, ethnicity (\"race\"), and socioeconomic status may each play a role in rendering individuals and groups vulnerable to extreme human suffering\" (42). For migrants, employment is a primary concern as the ability to work equals the possibility of surviving. Their added legal vulnerability leads many migrants to take low-wage jobs with little to no occupational safety. Their lifestyles in the United States are structured around labor and survival, where inequality materializes in the body. \nGiven the current political climate in the United States and the growing need for informed and engaged citizens equipped to work toward social justice and equity for all, this course will be crucial. The course approach emphasizes cultural competence, mutual benefit, and shared learning. It provides students with the tools and knowledge to understand and address the complex issues facing marginalized communities in the United States.\n\n\nThis undergraduate course explores the complex issues surrounding the US-Mexico border and the agricultural labor industry, focusing on the experiences and perspectives of migrant farmworkers and their families. The course design aims to cultivate students' understanding of the vulnerabilities of marginalized communities, specifically migrant agricultural laborers, and their relationship with these experiences. Through the designated modules, students will gain cultural competence and engage in a shared learning environment that promotes social and self-awareness regarding the impact of migration and the agricultural industry. Throughout the course, involvement with a variety of content ranging from research studies, activities, film, contemporary sources, student-led discussions and reflections, and community-engaged guest speakers, students will identify and address the growing disparities faced by migrant families living in the US, including issues related to education, health care, and housing. \nPREREQUISITE: At least one Foundational Course (SPAN 300 to 318W) or permission from the instructor",
