Students in the class will be confronted with questions of literary genre, questions of media, political critique in literature, and circulations of capital as presented in the picaresque. These questions will be read through the formulations of the picaresque hero and its figurations in the writings of the Early Modern period in Spain and its reinterpretation on the screen. Thus, the course will offer students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with a specific trend in literature in the Spanish tradition, and to explore the transhistorical tropes of the picaresque figure. In doing so, students will be able to analyze and interpret the social conditions framing the written and filmed pícaros in conversations with literature, politics, and religion. Some of the texts and film narratives addressed in the course are by the pen of Mateo Alemán, Francisco de Quevedo, or Miguel de Cervantes, together with literary and political theory by Jacques Derrida, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, or Jean-Francois Lyotard.\n\n\nReadings and films available in English and Spanish.",
