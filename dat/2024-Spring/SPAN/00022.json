    "class_notes": "Description: With the return to democracy in 1975, Spaniards gained the freedom to debate human rights questions in the press, television, literature, film, and the public sphere of digital social media. How is human rights discourse represented in Spanish culture? Conversely, how can this cultural production impact human rights policy? In exploring Spain¿s standing within the framework of European and international human rights theory and law, this course focuses on issues in the human rights arena that have gained prominence in contemporary Spanish society, including immigration and race; gender and sexuality; domestic and global terrorism. In their final research projects students may explore these topics or pursue additional avenues of interest (language rights; children¿s rights; the Okupas and Indignados movement; environmental rights, etc.).\n\n\nTexts: Will include examples of numerous genres, including journalism, literature (novels, short stories, poetry, memoirs), film, popular music, and social media. Background readings will provide an overview of the polemics surrounding humanitarian ethics in the age of globalization. Most readings will be available through Canvas and/or Woodruff Library.\nEvaluation: Active participation in class discussions; short written assignments; film review; final research paper.\nPrerequisites: Either (a)At least one (but preferably two) courses at the 300 level, one of which should be a foundational course for the Spanish Major or Minor\n(SPAN 300-318); or (b) one 400-level Spanish course. There may be exceptions to this. Students without these prerequisites should consult with the instructor to insure they¿re properly placed.",
