Students participate in paired, small-group, and whole-class conversation/listening activities that focus on meaningful communication as well as reading and writing. As such, the goals of this course include the following:\n1. learning to use Spanish to communicate, primarily in speaking and listening, but also in reading and writing;\n2. learning of and about the tools of communication: basic linguistic units (words, idioms, verb forms, sounds) and grammar (rules which permit you to combine the units meaningfully);\n3. and studying Hispanic cultures to begin to understand how culture affects language use.\nPrerequisite: successful completion of Spanish 101 at Emory, at Emory at Oxford, transfer credit for Span 101 from another institution, or permission of the Director of Placement",
