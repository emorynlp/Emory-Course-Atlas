The process of translation is a re-creation that requires intercultural as well as interlingual expertise. To this end, we will engage in identifying and translating genre and register; intralingual translation; comparing source texts to multiple translated texts; inverse translation; group translations and workshops; and editing, revising, reflection, analysis and commentary on their own translations. Classes meet once a week in English (together with students from ITAL and CHN) and once a week in language-specific workshops.\nPREREQUISITE: One course at the 300 level or explicit permission from the professor.\nInterested students must contact:\nsharlene.arruda.mendes@emory.edu for the enrollment permission number for SPAN 336\nlaura.a.hunt@emory.edu for the enrollment permission number for CHN 336\nlhartne@emory.edu for the enrollment permission number for ITAL 336",
