The emphasis of the course is on practical problem solving. All work is performed in Excel. However, little knowledge of Excel is necessary to begin the class. The particular problems of the course are slanted to attract those interested in finance and operations, but also include some marketing and HR problems. Finance oriented topics include asset allocation, arbitrage, short term cash flow planning, and balance sheet management, among others. Operations oriented topics include production planning, facility location, labor scheduling, blending, and others. The class is \"hands on.\" It will be necessary to have a computer with you in class.",
