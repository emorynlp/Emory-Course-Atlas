We will explore the current trends in supply networks, the link between supply chain and firm's strategy, and the issues of incentives, information sharing, trust, coordination, risk, resiliency, and logistical efficiency. Students with an interest in consulting, operations management, or business analytics are the primary target for this course. Students interested in private equity, investments, and marketing will find the course useful as those functions are often linked to supply chains (they are called value chains for a reason!)",
