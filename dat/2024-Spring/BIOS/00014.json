Students will learn how to document their research progress, conduct best practice on coding, peer-review each other's work, and write journal articles section by section through lectures and homework assignments. They will develop a manuscript based on their capstone project.  At the end of the semester, each student will give an oral presentation on his/her capstone project.  Each student will also make a poster on his/her capstone project.  Students will receive feedbacks from their peers and instructors to improve their writing and presentation skills.",
