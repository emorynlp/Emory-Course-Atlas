BIOS 516D ended with procedures for two independent samples (two sample t-test and chi-square test). Students then begin their study of linear regression, starting with one-predictor models and then moving on to multiple-predictor models. In addition, the course will cover ANOVA, ANCOVA, and non-independent hypothesis testing for paired and time-varying data.\n.",
