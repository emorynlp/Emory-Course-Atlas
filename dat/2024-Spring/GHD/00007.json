The course exposes students to advanced topics in applying research to practice and policy: complexity as it relates to human behavior, institutions, and governments; approaches to understanding complex systems; and evaluating population-wide interventions and policies using quasi-experimental study designs and sophisticated analytical approaches. It is expected that students will take specific classes on some of these topics to enhance their expertise in each.",
