In this course, we will begin by reading the Iliad and Odyssey slowly and carefully, with attention to detail, and we will discuss, with the help of scholars who have studied them, some of the many issues they raise. We will also sample the many works influenced by the Homeric epics, from ancient drama to contemporary novels and film.\nRequirements include several short papers, one ten-minute oral report, and contributions to class discussion. There will also be one larger final project in the interpretation of Homer, a longer essay or a creative project, e.g., a series of poems or a video production offering a reinterpretation of some aspect of the two poems.",
