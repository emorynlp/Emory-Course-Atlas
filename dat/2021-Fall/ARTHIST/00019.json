Drawing on different types of ancient sources as well as theoretical discussions from Egyptology and beyond, this course explores the various ways in which the relationship between an image and that which it depicts could be understood and utilized, covering the full cycle of attested practices of planning, making, using, altering, and destroying images.\nThis is an upper-level, writing-intensive seminar designed for students who have some experience with art history, typically having taken courses at the 200 or 300 level.\nArt History major/minor: Division I",
