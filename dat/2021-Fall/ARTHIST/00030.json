    "class_notes": "Complete Topic: Materials & Materiality in Medieval Art\nThis course asks the question, how can an approach based on awareness of materials contribute to understanding the meanings conveyed by works of medieval art? As Caroline Bynum stated in her landmark study, Christian Materiality (2011): \"The stuff of which medieval images were made was not incidental.\" At play in the case studies we'll examine in the course are how medieval artists and commentators thought about materials such as rock crystal, porphyry, mosaics, ivory, stone, parchment, and stained glass, and skillfully used them to reinforce visual impact and symbolic meaning within works of art.  The focus will be on the 11th-14th century, a formative period, when the church came to embrace the role of art in devotions and rising rates of literacy contributed to surprisingly frank and engaged discussions about works of art.",
