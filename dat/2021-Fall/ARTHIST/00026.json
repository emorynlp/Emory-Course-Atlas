Presentations and discussions will address historic materials and technologies, as well as aging properties, deterioration, and conservation treatment.  Discussions will consider issues of aesthetics, ethics, artist's intent, change over time, and compensation for damage.  We will also examine the use of science, review seminal debates in the recent history of conservation, and consider the role of conservation within collecting institutions and beyond. Examples will be drawn from a wide variety of cultures and will represent diverse media, including paper, paintings, stone, metals, ceramics, archaeological remains, and modern synthetic materials.",
