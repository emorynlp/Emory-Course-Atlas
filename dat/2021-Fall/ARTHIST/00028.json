This course will examine how collective memories can imbue the built environment and how scholars can examine social memory in the past. Past societies memorialized their own pasts, just as we do today Focusing on both the Greek and Roman worlds with examples from other Mediterranean cultures, we will cover topics such as theory of collective and individual memory, contested pasts, rebuilding and reuse, the deliberate memorialization or erasure of painful pasts, and ruins.",
