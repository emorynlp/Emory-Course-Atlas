Through the study of selected works of architecture and urban design, issues of political + social ideology, economy, building technology, materiality, siting, and climate will inform discussions of design process, form, and performance. We will investigate together how modernist buildings and urban spaces were realized and the ways in which they shaped and were shaped by culture in which they sat. Themes that thread through the course include industrialization, technology, power, patronage, identity, health and hygiene, and urbanization.\nArt History major/minor: Division III",
