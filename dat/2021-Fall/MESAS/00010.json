Yet despite the global focus on Israel, few onlookers actually have a strong understanding of Israel's complex and fragmented political system. This course will help you gain such an understanding by introducing you to the many political institutions, ideological visions, and demographic divisions that have driven Israeli politics from 1948 through the present day. While the course will familiarize you with many of the specifics of Israel - a Jewish state located in the Middle East - it also aims to give you a broader understanding of politics and how political institutions operate.)",
