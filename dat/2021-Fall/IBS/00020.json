    "course_description": "Understanding biological responses to external perturbations, their health outcomes, & risks requires a systems biology approach. Such an approach is necessary to make sense of biological pathways comprising genes, RNAs, proteins, & metabolites, & to understand how they are organized to carry out integrated, systems-level functions & respond to biological, pharmaceutical, & environmental perturbations. This interdisciplinary course introduces the basic concepts in systems biology & numerical simulation techniques for mechanically understand & predict biological responses.EHS 730 crosslisted w IBS 741.",
