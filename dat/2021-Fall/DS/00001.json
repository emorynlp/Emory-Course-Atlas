Attention is also given to the expansion of the Methodist Episcopal Church and Methodist Episcopal Church, South beyond the U.S. in the second half of the 19th century. Building on Wesley's thought, it addresses developments and modifications by his 19th and 20th century theological heirs and successors, especially in North America; and on contemporary discussions of doctrine and theology in the UMC.",
