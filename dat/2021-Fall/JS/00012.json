Ever since the emergence of the Zionist movement in the late nineteenth century, the political future of the land known as both Israel and Palestine has been the subject of fierce international debate. This seminar will examine how, exactly, this land has been discussed in international forums and in various countries, as well as how leaders of both Israelis and Palestinians have worked to chart a foreign policy for their respective peoples. Students will be given an overview of Israeli foreign policy and Palestinian attempts at global outreach since 1948 before the course moves on to explore the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in various regions of the world. \nCourse requirements include regular preparation and participation, facilitating one classroom discussion, one short review essay, and a final original research paper. Most research papers will focus on Palestinian or Israeli foreign relations with another country, or the role of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in that country or region's politics, either historically or today. While there is no fixed prerequisite for the course, students should either have some background in the politics and history of Israel or the Middle East, or have previous studied another country or region that they plan to examine in their research.\nReadings available on CANVAS",
