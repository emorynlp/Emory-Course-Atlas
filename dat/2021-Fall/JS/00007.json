Many of the signature features of modern Jewish life, in the realms of religion, culture, language, and politics (Hasidism, modern Jewish literature, Yiddish, Zionism, revolutionary socialism); derive from the centuries-long robust Jewish civilization in the East.  This course explores the origins, dynamic growth, and near destruction of East European Jewry from the Middle Ages to the Holocaust and the challenges to Jewish life in this region in the post-WWII era.  This course will make extensive use of primary documents: legal charters, memoirs, communal records, Hasidic tales, short stories, war reportage, to give us the tools to reconstruct this history together.  We will also watch films and critically assess the recent Broadway versions of Fiddler on the Roof.  This course fulfills the General Education Requirement in History, Society and Cultures and Race and Ethnicity.)",
