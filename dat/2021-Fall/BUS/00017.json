Alternate dates are only used if the instructor or the school has an emergency that causes one of the scheduled dates to be canceled (they will not be held as makeup dates for a missed class).  When signing up for a course, please remember to keep alternate dates free also.\n\n\nWe are currently experiencing one of the most fast-paced and innovative chapters in the history of the music business. After 15 years of decline, global recording revenues have begun to rebound with six consecutive years of growth. Atlanta deserves some credit for this resurgence as it is widely known as the hip hop capitol of the world. In this seminar students will meet with leaders and experts who will help them develop an understanding of how the music industry functions, how Atlanta has become an internationally recognized music city, and where the Atlanta music-scene is headed.  We will explore a range of topics, from artist development, artist compensation in the digital age, music technology, and the future of music consumption and distribution.\n\n\nThe delivery format listed for this class is based on current university guidelines. However, if there are further changes to the COVID19 guidelines for Fall 2021 or other acts beyond our control, the school reserves the right the modify the delivery method for this class.",
