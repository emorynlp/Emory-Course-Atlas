In this way, this course is very different from most law classes you may have taken either as an undergraduate or in any graduate legal education you may have. We will approach the study of judicial politics as just that - politics. The central questions that we will ask are: (1) What motivates judges?; (2) What incentives are created by judicial institutions?; and (3) How do those incentives affect the behavior of judicial actors?",
