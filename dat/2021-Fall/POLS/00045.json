These skills are needed for the quantitative and formal modeling courses offered in the political science department, and are increasingly necessary for courses in American Politics, Comparative Politics, and International Relations. We will cover mathematical techniques (linear algebra, calculus, probability) and methods of logical inference (proofs and notation). My ultimate goal is for you to 'nish the course being comfortable reading and using abstract mathematical notation and being able to apply the concepts we've learned to substantive problems you'll encounter in subsequent classes and your own research. Throughout the semester we will consider concrete applications of these tools to topics in political science.",
