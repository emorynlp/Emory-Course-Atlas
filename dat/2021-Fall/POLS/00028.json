What explains the rise and fall of left and right-wing governments in Latin America? What are the causes of the underrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities in political offices in Latin America? We begin the course by discussing the long-run causes of development in the region by examining the consequences of Spanish and Portuguese colonialism. We then move to a discussion of public policies and the role of markets, corruption, and state capacity in shaping policies. Finally, we discuss party politics and elections by examining political unrest, gender and race politics, partisanship, and campaigning in Latin America.",
