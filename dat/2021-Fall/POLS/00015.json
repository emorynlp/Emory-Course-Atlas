The course satisfies the post-freshman GER writing requirement by focusing on scientific writing. The course also introduces students to the use of R to conduct statistical analyses. Knowledge of R is increasingly valuable for all students, both while in college and after graduation. Here we study how to utilize descriptive statistics, frequency tables, regression, and logistic regression, all using real data sets. There is a final paper, and students will submit various drafts of this paper during the semester so that the instructor can offer feedback to the writing process",
