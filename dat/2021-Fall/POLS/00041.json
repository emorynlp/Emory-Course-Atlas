    "class_notes": "The Honors Tutorial in Political Science is a course designed especially for senior Political Science and International Studies majors who are pursuing an honors degree. The goal of the course is straightforward: to help students transform their research topics into clear questions and to design a project that analyzes those questions through rigorous, original research using the methods of political science. By the end of this course, each student will have carefully prepared a full introduction to their honors thesis, the main elements of which are: (1) a clearly stated research question; (2) a review and analysis of relevant literature; (3) theory and hypotheses to be tested (when applicable); and (3) a detailed research plan. Thus, students will be well on their way in the preparation of well-reasoned, feasible, rigorous, and interesting honors theses.",
