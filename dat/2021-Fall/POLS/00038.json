Students interested in enrolling in this course should complete a short application, which can be found at this link: http://polisciemory.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_74zIgKVGez0WCZn\n\n\nThis course introduces students to policymaking in the American states with a focus on Georgia. It will cover the transformation of ideas into public policies, with attention to three key phases of the policymaking process--advocacy (issue framing and agenda setting), policy design (formulating policy options), and policy evaluation (assessing the effects of public policies). For each of these phases we will pay close attention to the types of actors engaged in this phase of policymaking and how-if at all-they use and provide evidence to support their claims. While our focus is on Georgia, we will also examine how Georgia's political institutions and policymaking processes compare with other states.\n\n\nIn-person work with state house and community organizations will be a substantial component of the course. Students will work in teams of 3-4 students, matched with a state legislative study committee, on an important state policy issue. We will aim to have a reasonable balance between students working with state legislators and staff (upper and lower chambers, legislative committees, etc.) and with statewide advocacy organizations drawn from a variety of policy areas (e.g., health, environment, early learning, education, mental health, workforce development, economic development, voting rights, immigration, etc.).\nStudent experiential work will focus on assembling and presenting credible and persuasive evidence to better inform state policymakers on matters pertaining to needs assessment, policy design/analysis, and program evaluation. Students will also participate in online/national network opportunities available through the ENACT Network (Educational Network for Active Civic Transformation), based at Brandeis University (https://www.brandeis.edu/ethics/ENACT/index.html).",
