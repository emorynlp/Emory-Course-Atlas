Is it possible to live without it? This course will provide an overview of contemporary theoretical approaches to violence and American culture. In particular, we will interrogate the relationship between violence and identity, subjection and Ethics, knowledge and violence, and pleasure and terror. The course will consider the theoretical difficulties of studying violence: how do we isolate it as a conceptual object? Is there anything outside of violence, or is the world itself violence? We will examine",
