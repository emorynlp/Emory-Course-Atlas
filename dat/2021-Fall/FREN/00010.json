    "class_notes": "French 331: Urban Love and Modern Experience\nElissa Marder / In Person MW 1-2:15PM\nContent:  In 19th and 20th century French literature, the city of Paris is not merely a place where textual action transpires, the `city of dreams' as Baudelaire called it, becomes a text that can be read. It emerges as a character capable of motivating events and making history.  By reading a selection of literary and filmic `tableaux parisiens,' we will explore how modern conceptions of life, love, and history come into being and we will show how the inner lives of the city's inhabitants are shaped by the urban spaces in which they unfold.  Primary texts include selections of works by: Mercier, Balzac, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Vall√®s, Huysmans, Zola, Aragon, and Godard. Taught in French.",
    "course_description": "This course focuses on the development of key concepts, ideas, or movements across historical periods and cultural contexts.
