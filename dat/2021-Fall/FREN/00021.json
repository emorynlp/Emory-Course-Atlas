This course will explore tyranny as political device and literary trope in works by writers and thinkers who use dictatorship as an analytic lens through which to understand and reconfigure asymmetries in power, language and thought. Theoretical readings will include Frantz Fanon, Achille Mbembe and Hannah Arendt. Literary works may include Sony Labou Tansi (La vie et demie), Tchicaya Utam'si (Le destin glorieux du maréchal Nnikon Nniku), Ahmadou Kourouma (En Attendant le vote des bêtes sauvages), Véronique Tadjo (Le royaume aveugle), Gérard Étienne (Un Nègre crucifié), Marie Vieux Chauvet (Amour, Colère, Folie), Anna Moï (Nostalgie de la rizière), Linda Lê (Cronos), Shan Sa (Porte de la Paix Céleste).",
