Both opposed totalitarianism of the right (Hitler) and the left (Stalin) though they disagreed on nearly everything else. Both were front-line soldiers, Churchill in World War I and Orwell in the Spanish Civil War, so their writings on war were based on first-hand experience. The course will study their writings on politics, patriotism, imperialism, war, socialism, and equality. Among the assignments will be Orwell's Animal Farm and Homeage to Catalonia, and Churchill's Second World War and Eminent Contemporaries. Three short papers, a mid-term and a final exam. The course is affiliated with the Voluntary Core Curriculum, Emory's great-books program.",
