Medieval society was far from homogenous: it was Christian, Muslim, and Jewish; it was elite, bourgeois, lower class, and enslaved, secular and religious, rural and urban, learned and non-literate. This course explores the spectrum of masculinity in medieval society by looking at profession, education, social status, ethnicity, race, and religious identity. How is it that celibacy and spiritual prowess marked the clergy as masculine and men who engaged in too much sex as feminine? How did men emasculate one another? Why did men need women and slaves to perform their masculinity? We will also consider the roles of religious minorities in Christian societies and how contact with Islam in the Crusades affected the gender identity of men in European society. In addition, we will study how Christian ideas about the proper gender roles for men and women intersected with religious ideas about men's sexuality and consider how gender difference in the Middle Ages produced gender inequality.",
