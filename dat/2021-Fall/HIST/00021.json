How have movements for racial, class, and gender inclusion shaped this island's history? How has a popular revolutionary imagination persisted on the island throughout the past two hundred years in the context of outside military intervention, economic embargoes, and large-scale migration? We will learn about life in Cuba from the perspective of a diverse group of protagonists: indigenous Ta√≠nos, enslaved and formerly enslaved people during the late nineteenth century, peasants and squatters, student founders of the Communist Party, factory workers, film-makers, entertainers, teachers, doctors, foreign observers, and Cuban-Americans. We will read first-hand accounts, as well as scholarship authored by historians, anthropologists, and sociologists. We will also watch movies and documentaries authored by leading artists on the island.",
