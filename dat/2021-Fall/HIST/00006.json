Fake news has become important part of our daily political culture, whether in the United States or elsewhere around the globe.  Elections and public policy have been influenced by them. Our course will delve into several historical cases of hoaxes, history \"deniers,\" and media exploitation before turning to the recent past and even daily events in the US and elsewhere.  Most especially we will probe the many fake news stories that emerged in 2020 and 2021, among others, conspiracy theories and fake news related to voter fraud, election interference, political figures, COVID19, and the insurrection at the US Capitol. We will look at international examples of these phenomena. What dynamics have historians identified that can illuminate the contemporary world? We will explore the place of social media such as Twitter and Facebook, as well as darker parts of the web, in purveying false information.  For instance, how do 'fake news' authors use language, music, and images to make their ideas more persuasive? How has technology increased the power of 'fake news'?",
