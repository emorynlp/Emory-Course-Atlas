How do race and gender function in relation to each other? Is Blackness a racialization that is different from the production of other kinds of racial imaginaries? In this course, we will explore various theoretical and philosophical readings on race, gender, and various institutions that are integral in the production of racial technologies and political discourses. We will read works by scholars in law, philosophy, sociology, politics, history, and feminist theory, among other fields through the lens of different forms of the carceral state.",
