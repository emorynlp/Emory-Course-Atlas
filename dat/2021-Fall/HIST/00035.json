We will key in on major themes and turning points in the development of Mexican society, including Spanish conquest and colonialism, independence and modernization, the Mexican Revolution, migration from Mexico to the United States, and narco-trafficking. Throughout, students will hone analytical and writing skills by interacting with diverse materials, including primary documents (i.e. letters, testimony, and travel accounts), visual sources (i.e. paintings, photographs, and political cartoons), fiction, and journalism. Major questions include: How can we understand the relationship between state and society from a historical perspective?  How do certain state forms, such as a \"revolutionary state\" or a \"narco-state\" emerge, and why do they endure or fail?",
