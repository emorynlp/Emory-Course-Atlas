    "class_notes": "This discussion-driven seminar will explore exciting trends in the study of the intersection between politics and culture, with a focus upon the crisis-ridden transition to mass politics, mass culture, and urban modernity in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Europe.  The course will touch on high and popular culture, the development of urban modernity and modernism, the rise of radical nationalist, antisemitic, and proto-fascist politics, the relationship between colonialism and the metropole, changing conceptions and experiences of gender, the invention of tradition, and the spread of urban currents into rural areas.  You may also find yourselves becoming strangely familiar with the world cities Paris, Vienna, and Berlin, our prime examples.  The range of important and innovative approaches examined makes this course useful for students doing research or preparing portfolios in other fields and disciplines as well, and they may focus their final papers on those other areas where possible and thematically related.",
