    "class_notes": "Renaissance women left an astonishing textual legacy ranging from letters, orations and memoirs to treatises, plays, and imaginative tales. This course uses select texts to investigate how European women used writing to shape, interpret and comment on the world around them between 1400 and 1600, a period that witnessed the advent of printing, the break-up of Christianity, and the first age of globalization. In exploring the ways that writing offered a vehicle for personal expression and agency, we will also probe the barriers that Renaissance women faced in becoming literate and in publishing their work. The course examines women's writings in the context of religious and family life as well as works written by women in the public eye, whether as political rulers, courtesans, or published authors. The course aims to introduce students to women's historical experiences while improving critical reading and writing skills. Readings focus on primary sources, most of which will be available electronically on Canvas; we will make regular use of visual materials such as video clips to bring the period to life. Grading will be based on several short papers, class participation, and rotating turns as discussion leader. This is a discussion-based course; there are no scheduled examinations.",
