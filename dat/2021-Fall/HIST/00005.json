Images of extreme poverty and drug-related violence are often punctuated by references to elite vacationing and tax havens for the rich. Both sets of representations suggest that the Caribbean is a provincial corner of the world, where the rules that we are accustomed to in North America and Europe do not apply. The course will challenge these representations by showing continuities between European, US, African, and Caribbean histories. Through a range of primary sources, we will learn about major political-economic processes and social mobilizations that occurred within the Caribbean, turning this world region into a testing ground for modern ideologies and institutions undergirding globalization and liberal democracy. We will ask: why have the Caribbean's contributions to histories of global capitalism and political radicalism been largely forgotten or erased from the popular imagination?\n\n\n(Freshmen Only)",
