    "class_notes": "This advanced seminar introduces students to the field of 'transpacific studies.' By tracing the lives of migrants, students, journalists, missionaries and political activists, it investigates historical connections between the United States and Asia that have been obscured by traditional, nation-bound narratives. It also exposes students to a wide range of archival sources (including diaries, letters, newspapers, photographs, oral histories, and autobiographies) to learn how historians construct narratives and arguments. For the final project, students will produce a 20-page original research paper centering on a historical figure, or a group of historical figures, whose transpacific life histories can shed light on unknown aspects of the history of US-Asian relations.",
