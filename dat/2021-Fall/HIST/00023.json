We will study the relationship between law and a nation's culture, and how the law both reflects society and structures society. Texts will include oral traditions, national constitutions, treaties, a novel, podcasts, images, and films, as well as a secondary text (Richotte's Federal Indian Law and Policy). We will introduce you to the social and political organization of Native societies; concepts such as ethnocentricity, reciprocity, resistance, and sovereignty; the legacies of colonialism; citizenship in both tribal and U.S. contexts; and how Native people use the law to ensure their survival. We will discuss topics including: the relationship between tribes, states, and the federal government; race and racism; gender, marriage, and family life; political authority and conflict; and land and religion. This introductory course is ideal for anyone seeking to understand the challenges that Native people face today and how culture influences law.",
