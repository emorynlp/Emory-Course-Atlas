To situate ourselves, we open the semester with a definition of the field and some of its early, seminal contributions. We proceed with two regional environmental histories before moving to the transnational level to capture one of the characteristics of environmental forces: they do not observe human-made boundaries. However, in view of \"the interconnectedness of all parts of the planet in matters ecological,\" as J. R. McNeill writes, environmental historians have increasingly embraced macro-scale histories as well to match the scale of contemporary environmental challenges like climate change. We thus conclude with global environmental histories. In topical terms, we touch upon histories of nature conservation and national parks, histories of rivers, animal history, nuclear history, and ecofeminism. Most works we read in this class address the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and a wide range of geographic settings. The class is thus suitable for students of American, Latin American, European, African and Asian histories. Assignments include active participation; weekly discussion posts on the books we read; a book review; a historiographical final paper.",
