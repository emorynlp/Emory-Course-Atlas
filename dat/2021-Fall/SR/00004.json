    "course_description": "This course explores the history of institution building within the African American community. While black churches are the oldest black institutions in the U.S., out of these organizations have emerged black schools, colleges & businesses. While many of these institutions were established in the crucible of racial segregation, some presently struggle for viability in a presumably \"post-racial\" U.S. We will examine their historical development as well as the contemporary issues that animate their existence and trace how multiple & changing formations of blackness influence their future.",
