Using neuroscience and philosophy, we will dive deeper into the neural and conceptual bases that engender different worldviews and ways of being in the world. This course will explore concepts such as creativity, imagination, empathy, service, mindfulness, and nature. Each session will be an experiment in engaging difference through interactions with common places and things. Students will have the opportunity to explore the greater Atlanta area while gaining an understanding of how to effectively contribute to various communities in ways that correspond to each student's unique values, interests, skills, and passions.",
