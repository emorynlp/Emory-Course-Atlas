The act of creation is seen across all disciplines and is often done to improve spiritual, physical, or emotional growth. This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to explore what it means \"to create\". Relying on case studies from biomolecular chemistry and Italian baroque art and architecture (17th-18th centuries), we will examine the processes, ethics, and controversies involved in creative acts. Together, we will also consider how ideas are classified as new or novel, the various actors involved in creative processes, and who receives credit for it. We wrap up the course by drawing attention to those historically excluded in the creation/recognition process.",
