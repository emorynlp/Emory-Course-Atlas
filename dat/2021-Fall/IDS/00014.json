    "class_notes": "Through this course, we will seek to define the concept of \"neurodiversity\". What characteristics must one possess in order to be within this group? Who gets to call themselves \"neurodiverse\"? Is there a \"group\"? What does it mean to be within this group or to be a neurodiverse individual? What are the bounds of being \"neurodiverse\" and what are some key personal, social, and societal implications? We will explore this concept primarily through the lens of psychology with perspectives on individual and social development and societal functioning. In addition, perspectives on neurodiversity reflected in literature, culture, biology, ethics (and other disciplines) will be included. We will examine how autism and other diagnosed and undiagnosed conditions can exemplify this concept. Mission of the Course: To engage students in readings, thought exercises, discussions, and experiences as an overview of neurodiversity as a meaningful socio-cultural concept, and with insight into specific aspects of the lived experience of individuals who experience obstacles or exclusion because of their perceived mental, psychological, and behavioral differences.",
