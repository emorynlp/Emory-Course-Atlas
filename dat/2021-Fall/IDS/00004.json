Interested seniors can contact the instructor for permission to enroll.\n   This interdisciplinary course explores the challenges of environmental sustainability through social, economic, scientific, and ethical lenses. Through readings from the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, the course aims to instill broad, integrative and critical thinking about global environmental problems that require approaches from many fields of knowledge to adequately recognize and address. As we work to acquire literacy in current sustainability issues and debates, we will discuss three recent books and a number of articles that relate to issues such as environmental stress, climate change and climate action, intergenerational justice, healthy agriculture, our 'ecological footprint,' what the 'Anthropocene' age means, and, ultimately, what it will take for human civilizations to continue to thrive.",
