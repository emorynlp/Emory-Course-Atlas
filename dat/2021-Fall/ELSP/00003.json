    "course_description": "Advanced speakers (OPI level 3) can narrate and describe in the past, present, and future time frames in paragraph-length discourse. Although they may have varying degrees of fluency and accuracy, advanced speakers can convey their message without confusion and be understood by listeners not accustomed to ESL speakers. However, they may lack the language to discuss topics extensively, participate in formal and professional conversations, and consistently provide a structured argument in extended discourse. ELSP 517 is designed to improve the communication skills of advanced students.",
