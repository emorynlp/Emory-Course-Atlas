    "course_description": "This course will cover the fundamental single-molecule techniques and illustrate their physical principles and how they may be used for the study of biological materials. In particular, the physical principles of atomic force microscopy (static and dynamic), electron microscopy, tethered particle motion (TPM), nanoparticle manipulation (magnetic and optical tweezers), single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, and super-resolution microscopy will be discussed. Demonstrations of some of these techniques will be offered. Examples of the application of each of these techniques to biophysical problems will be discussed using current publications.  Each student will be required to present articles from the literature to the class and participate in vigorous discussions.",
