The course takes place during the first half of the fall semester (second year, for most students).  Students will have opportunities to identify and/or refine potential integrative learning experience (ILE) project topics.  Students will also review:  criteria for selection of a project topic, objectivity in science, research design issues, and use of the literature.  Students will complete a brief plan for the steps in the development of their potential projects.  Students will then have opportunities to develop and apply their analytical and writing skills in the development of their integrative learning experience project proposal.  Students will refine their research questions and/or project objectives, formulate plans for data management and analysis, and prepare and present their project proposal to departmental faculty for review, comment and approval.",
