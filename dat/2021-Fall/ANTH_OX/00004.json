We pay special attention to the way genders are performed and the important role of language in the construction of genders. While all cultures identify and mark differences in gender, there is an incredible diversity in the ways that they do so. In this course, we will explore the ways the people from different times and different communities imagine, practice, experience, challenge, and impose ideas of gender and sexuality.",
