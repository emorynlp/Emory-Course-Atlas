The course will introduce the Persian alphabet alongside grammar and vocabulary, and will emphasize using the language for communication. This class focuses on the development of interpersonal, interpretative, and presentational modes of communication, with special attention to vocabulary and pronunciation. Information about cultural products, perspectives, and practices has been included in the course content in order to encourage students to use Persian to make connections to and comparisons with other communities and disciplines. Because learning a language requires regular study and since this course is intensive, students can expect to spend a considerable amount of time each day reviewing and studying Persian outside of the class.)",
