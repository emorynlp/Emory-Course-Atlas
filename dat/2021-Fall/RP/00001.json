    "course_description": "This course explores the meaning of religious experience from a variety of psychological perspectives. Our method will be to examine the theoretical models and empirical measures associated with several major figures in the field: William James, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Erik and Joan Erikson, Ana-Maria Rizzuto, Lawrence Kohlberg, and James Fowler. For each theorist, students will read a classic text, engage in critical reflection, and utilize a related measure of religiosity.",
