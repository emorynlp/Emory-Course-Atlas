Phonology studies the sound patterns found in human language and refers to the knowledge that speakers have about the sound patterns in their particular language. Areas of focus in this course include articulatory phonetics, segmental and non-linear phonology, phonetics/phonology interface, and experimental approaches to sound analysis. Both theoretical and methodological issues will be discussed. The format of the course will be primarily lecture and discussion.",
