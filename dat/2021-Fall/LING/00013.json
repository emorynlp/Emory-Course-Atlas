In this course, we will address the management or planning efforts by nations and institutions to influence language use as well as how individuals create, reproduce, and respond to policies. As we address LPP from different contexts (society, community, and individual), we will explore the objectives and expected outcomes found within the policies. Further, this course will use case studies to familiarize learners with the methodologies and approaches that support LPP research and the opportunity to apply them in practice.",
