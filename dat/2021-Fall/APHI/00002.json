The evaluation of information system lifecycles and how they affect the planning and management process is also examined and students will gain experience with the tools to apply the impacts. Students will learn about ways to ensure that the milestones, change management, and quality assurance procedures are in place to deliver the solutions to meet public health needs. Students will also learn techniques, resources, and tools that assist in the analyses and documentation of workflows and business processes, which can be translated into requirements for public health information systems that drive the planning and management process. This course relies heavily on scenarios which require students to apply tools or methods taught in each module.",
