In relation to the broader goals of the program, this course focuses specifically on helping participants achieve advanced integration of theology and practice; analyze a ministry setting, using appropriate research methods and exhibiting contextual sensitivity; and, articulate a coherent ecclesiology that serves as the ongoing basis for ministerial practice in the parish setting. The goal of the course is to prompt participants to reflect systematically on the nature and task of the church, both in relationship to God's Reign, on the one hand, and to the present world, on the other. This course builds off of the tools of congregational and social analysis introduced in both DM700 and DM711, and is designed to prepare students for more focused work in liturgical and church leadership in the second and third years of the program.",
