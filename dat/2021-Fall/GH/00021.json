    "course_description": "The course aims to introduce students to the pervasiveness and complexity of ethical\nchallenges in global health. The goal of this course is to provide students with knowledge, skills and opportunities to critically examine and address ethical challenges associated with key aspects of global health. The course aims to complement other global health and public health courses by emphasizing critical analysis of the ethical and practical implications of global health and the assumptions, conventions, and practices that dominate the field.  Given the unique impact and global  challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the course will draw on cases and current ethical controversies associated with COVID-19 to examine some of the key ideas and concepts in global health ethics. Through the assigned readings, course assignments and interactions with guest speakers, students will be challenged to develop conceptual thinking and problem-solving skills relevant to 4 of the main professional activities associated with practice of global health ethics: (1) providing global health organizations with diagnoses of ethical challenges that arise within their portfolios, i.e., what is the nature of the ethical challenge¿what¿s the best way to conceptualize and understood the challenge; (2) provide advice and guidance on how to address ethical challenges in creative and practical ways; (3) expert committee and panel reviews of policies or proposals; and (4) thought partnership and deliberation  with global health organizations to help them design, manage and evaluate global health projects, programs, policies and management practices to ensure they meet the highest ethical standards.",
