    "class_notes": "Is being culturally Asian an impediment to living harmoniously in the modern world? Is modernization equivalent to Westernization? Are Asian thoughts inherently backward and illiberal? This is an introductory course to some major traditions in Asian philosophy, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism, Legalism, and so on. We will look at the original texts as well as their modern interpretations with these questions in mind: are those traditions compatible with modern values such as liberty, equality, science, and democracy? Is it possible to tap into Asia's rich intellectual resources without evoking undesirable consequences such as authoritarianism, cultural chauvinism, misogynism, racism, so on and so forth? Furthermore, will those intellectual resources even help dealing with today's toughest problems like inequality, violence, and environmental degradation?",
