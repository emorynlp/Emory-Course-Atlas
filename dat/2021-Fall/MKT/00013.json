Whether you are a marketer communicating to consumers, an entrepreneur to investors or a consultant to a client, story is the greatest tool you have to break through the noise. This course teaches the elements of powerful stories and \"sticky\" ideas. The foundation elements of the course will then allow us to examine the Core Creative Idea (CCI) of brands like Peloton and how that CCI is applied on platforms of the digital age including podcasts, email marketing, influencers and TikTok.",
