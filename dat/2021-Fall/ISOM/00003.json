    "course_description": "Simulation modeling is a valuable tool for business, public health, health care, marketing, and many other disciplines. In this course we will examine a unique and popular type: agent based systems (ABS). ABS fill a niche that other approaches cannot fill; therefore, they are often used in complement to other approaches. ABS often are used for modeling types of markets, pandemics, supply chains, strategies, policies, collaborations, and many other social-collective dynamic phenomena. This is a programming course that has no programming prerequisites. In this course you will learn the fundamentals of computational modeling, running ABS experiments, basic data analytics and visualization.",
