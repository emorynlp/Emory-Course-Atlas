With its disease and organ focus, the biomedical paradigm organizes the body into organ systems, each engaged in unique processes, with specific functions or alterations in structure and function that we diagnose as organ-based diseases. By contrast, evidence suggests that parsimony was the evolutionary reality, with common processes operational across the body such that the functionality of these fundamental pathways results in many diseases from similar causes. This course explores the evidentiary basis for understanding how generic processes shape human physiology. Evolutionary perspectives provide a background for understanding the limitations imposed by biomedical frameworks in our understanding of human biological variability. Flexibility in gene expression and human phenotypes reflect the importance of biocultural influences on health.",
