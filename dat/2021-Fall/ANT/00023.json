We will trace anthropological debates about how humans understand, engage, and interact with and through their environments. We will ask: How do different groups of people around the world understand the relation between human/non-human, nature/culture, and why does this matter? How have understandings of basic elements of human existence: land, water, and air, varied across time and place? How do diverse groups manage their environment through social and political organization, subsistence and social practice, and technological innovation? And how are people around the world and here in Atlanta experiencing, producing, and fighting against toxicity, climate change, and environmental racism? Students will participate in short on-campus field trips to explore their own situatedness in place, nature, and environmental practice.)",
