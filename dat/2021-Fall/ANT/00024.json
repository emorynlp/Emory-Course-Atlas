Topics will include:  mechanisms of evolutionary change in neural systems; mammalian brain specializations; brain changes that accompanied primate origins; changes that accompanied the evolution of the New World and Old World monkeys; and ape and human brain specializations.  Sensory systems will be surveyed - especially the visual system, which was highly modified in primate evolution, as well as sensorimotor, limbic, and higher-order association systems.)",
