Using insights from anthropology, cultural studies, Black studies and Ethnic Studies, this course will explore the dynamic and contested forms of racialization that have emerged since the era of Western colonization and transatlantic slavery. Seminar participants will also interrogate the intellectual history of race within biological anthropology, and critically engage topics including Genomics, Natural Selection, Eugenics, Forensics, and genetic identity. This seminar offers a curated selection of texts from a rapidly expanding literature across anthropology and other social science fields in order to understand race and racism as interrelated domains of power and domination in a post-1492 world.",
