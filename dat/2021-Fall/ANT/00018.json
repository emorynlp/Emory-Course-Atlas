    "class_notes": "This course will be an ethnographic immersion in non-Western, non-biomedical healing systems and the worldviews on which they rest.  We will examine the ideas that various different cultures hold about the nature of the cosmos in which we live, and our place in it; as well as the role of the many other-than-human agents who also inhabit their conceptual worlds who can influence people's health and well-being.  Along the way we will 'meet' various shamans, 'spirit mediums', and other healers; and we will also examine some of the ramifications of the encounter between non-western medical systems and contemporary western society and its medical, cosmological and metaphysical beliefs.  In addition to the written ethnography there will be several films that complement the readings.",
