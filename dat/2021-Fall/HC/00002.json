Emphasis in this course is on depth over breadth: rather than taking a tour through American religious/political history since 1865, class will focus on three key themes: race & empire, gender & sexuality, & religious & political realignments since the civil rights era. Students will learn about each theme through scholarly books and articles, supplemented with related primary source materials, memoir, essays, film, and music.",
