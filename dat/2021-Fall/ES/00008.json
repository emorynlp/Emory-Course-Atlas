    "course_description": "Apocalyptic language pervades current talk about the environment. Whether covering wild fires, extreme weather, or urban rat infestations, journalists, activists, and public intellectuals construct this discourse by calling on the apocalyptic to indicate the urgent, world altering impact of these phenomenon. In dialogue with this popular discourse, this course draws upon theological traditions of apocalyptic reflection to analyze the attritional catastrophe of our current climate crisis.",
