    "course_description": "In this course, students will survey the interdisciplinary field of law and religion. The course will begin by discussing the nature of the field known as law and religion. The course will then cover different substantive areas and methodological approaches by reading, analyzing, and critiquing examples of law and religion scholarship from leading scholars. Students will be asked to think about the choices that scholars make: What is the relationship of law and religion? What does the scholar draw on as evidence for her argument? How does the scholar construct his argument? How does the scholar think about law and about religion?",
