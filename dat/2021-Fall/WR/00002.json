    "course_description": "This course seeks to draw students into a world of distinctive language, ideas, and meaning that is radically different from the Christian religion with which they and Rastafari are always in conversation. In addition it will highlight the basic concepts, doctrines, aims, and issues of faith and culture in Rastafari. The engagement with Rastafari practices, customs, beliefs, and institutions will begin the process of taking Rastas' social location, engagement with the Bible (a text Rastas claim was written by black people) other cultural texts (the Holi Piby) and the reggae rhythms of Bob Marley as mediums for navigating the challenge of difference embedded in Rastafari. Further, Rastas will be invited to class to make possible a more direct access to the religion. (Race, Ethnicity, and Gender).",
