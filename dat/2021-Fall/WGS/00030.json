This latter section will draw specifically from works within critical race scholarship, indigenous understandings of queerness, and science and technology studies, as well as from queer legal theory and its attention to questions of governance and power. Throughout, we will ask what work that queer might perform as an object, subject, modifier, foundation, imaginary, genealogy, trajectory, archive, and/or form of solidarity.",
