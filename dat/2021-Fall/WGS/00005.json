    "class_notes": "In the 1990s, the term \"transgender\" came into prominence in activism, social services, and the academy in the West as a term for forms of gender variance - including transsexuality, drag, transvestitism, and non-binary genders - that previously has no common name. In the process, it has shifted both the possibilities for political mobilization around gender variance and the relationship between gender, sexuality, and sex. This course will study the cultural, political, and epistemological transformations that the term transgender has wrought. We will explore contemporary trans activism; the impact of medicalization on trans identities; the politics of contemporary trans representation; the long history of gender variance; Black and brown trans cultures; and indigenous and non-Western forms of gender variance that cannot be accurately described by the term transgender.",
