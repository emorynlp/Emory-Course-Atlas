Comparing ancient texts with contemporary narratives, students will learn to discern appropriate sources to construct arguments in written and oral forms. A focus will be on the question of evidence, what counts for good evidence and how to use it in humanities research. The materials we will engage will be both delightful and challenging, and will open our eyes to new ways of engaging with history, literature, religion, and gender.)",
