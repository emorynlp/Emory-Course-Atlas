The course studies the connectedness of our social, technological and biological worlds through the lens of graphs and networks.\nThis semester, we will look into how people are connected in social networks; how opinions, disease and political activism spreads through society; how communities form and can be inferred from data; theories underlying strong and weak ties in relationships; ranking of the web hyperlink graph (PageRank), and various other topics. We will study models and theory to help explain and exploit the structure of information and social networks. We will also discuss some tools to analyze these networks",
