Indeed, there are few contemporary issues that invoke as many opinions and emotions as the topic of global development.   This course will introduce students to the growing interdisciplinary field of development studies and provide a solid foundation for subsequent course work in the Global Development Studies Minor and, eventually, possible career tracks. Because of the complexity and multi-faceted nature of the topic, the course will include materials from a range of different academic disciplines, but with an emphasis on the social sciences especially anthropology.   It will provide an overview of how scholars and practitioners research and apply their knowledge toward understanding and solving some of the world's most challenging problems.  Through readings and class discussion, students will learn about several key topics related to development, including human rights, gender, environment, poverty and inequality, governance, climate change, and agrarian systems. Because of the current challenges of the COVID Pandemic, Inequality, Racism, and Social Justice in the US and around the world, we also will use the opportunity (\"a teaching moment\") to discuss these topics both in the context of global development, as well as 'development' in high-income countries like the US.
