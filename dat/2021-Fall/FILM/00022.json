The film theorist Patricia Pisters has even suggested that we now live in a \"universe of metacinema\". We shall take as our tutor text Thomas Nail's book, Theory of the Image, which provides both a theoretical basis for our study and a history of how specific kinds of images the digital image or the generative image, for example--have been dominant in particular cultures and at particular historical moments. We'll also give special attention to Henri Bergson's theory of the image, which is directly tied to the birth of cinematography, as well as to Gilles Deleuze's two cinema books on the \"movement image\" and the \"time-image\", as well as to Pisters' book on the \"neuro-image\". Finally, depending on the time available and class interest, we will spend some class time on pattern recognition, and how the human brain processes the perception of images and their storage in memory.",
