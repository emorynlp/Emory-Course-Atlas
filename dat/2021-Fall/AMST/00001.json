    "class_notes": "What does it mean to be American? Who counts as an American; and who doesn't? Over the past few years, the coronavirus pandemic, movements for social change, and immigration policy have brought these questions into sharp focus, starting a national conversation on the American society we live in and the one we would like to create. This class will look at current events: the pandemic, immigration, issues of social justice and racial and class inequality, and set them in an historical context. We will draw connections between past events and the conversations they provoked about the idea of 'America' to events happening today. For example, what can we learn from flu epidemic of 1918 that will help us understand America's reaction to the coronavirus? How do current social movements, both progressive and conservative, build on history and react to one another? What role do social movements play in defining American identity? This course will explore how people experience disruptive cultural events given their own identities and roles in American society, how the media and other cultural artifacts frame such events, and how such events might encourage (or inhibit) social change. Using the methods and key ideas of American Studies scholarship, we will seek to begin to understand and define for ourselves what it means to be American.",
