How do memoirs, acts of narrative- and self-construction, use memory in the creation and revision of lived meaning? How do writers navigate the lines between truth and fact? What are some of the literary strategies that make for a compelling memoir? Addressing these and other questions, this course examines the choices memoirists make as they negotiate both memory and self-identifications such as gender, race, class, sexual orientation, geography, and religion. Readings will focus on a diverse variety of modern memoirs (books and essays), in addition to academic articles and studies on memory. In papers and journal entries, students will begin to learn the art of writing memoir themselves.)",
