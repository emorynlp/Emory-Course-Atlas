The course will also help you develop critical thinking skills that can be applied to your other courses, regardless of subject matter.\nThe term \"canon\" may be problematic; yet, if one reads these texts closely and better appreciates their multifaceted nature, more substantial critiques and alternative perspectives can be offered. Through your close reading and discussion, you will eventually be able to ask fundamental questions, such as: What makes the classical canon a canon? How are those works relevant for our world? Why should (or shouldn't) one read these texts?",
