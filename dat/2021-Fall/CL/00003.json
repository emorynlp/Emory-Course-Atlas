In creating this window, we will travel through a storied series of relatability: we will examine and assess how many things considered to be modern phenomena, unique to our present modern circumstances; are, in fact, already present in some form more than two thousand years ago. Topics will include (but are not limited to) generation gaps, fan fiction , social media, cancel culture, AI, and sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll. This course will be reading and discussion-based, and will appeal to those interested in making cross-cultural connections and broadening perspectives on what the ancient world is all about.",
