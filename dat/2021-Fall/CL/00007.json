Over a thousand-year period (500 BC - 500 AD), the Romans created the ancient world's most comprehensive body of law, whose legacy would have a profound influence on modern legal systems.  This course will utilize the both real and imagined cases to help students grapple with the realities of the Roman law and explore its uses in context.  Students will also have the opportunity to write their own cases for the class to explore. No previous knowledge of Latin or Roman history is required.",
