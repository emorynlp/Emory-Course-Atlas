While archaeological investigation is in many ways about solving ancient mysteries, archaeology is grounded in rigorous methodologies, careful accumulation and analysis of data, and scientific method. This course explores where pseudoarcheology comes from and the cultural work it does, and introduces the foundations of archaeological methods and scientific inquiry. Students will develop critical thinking skills and analytical tools to evaluate evidence, and will engage with larger questions about uses of history and the evolution of political and religious ideologies that are built on historical and archaeological ideas. Along the way, we learn about who really did build the pyramids, what happened to Atlantis, and what the Fascists found in the Roman forum.",
