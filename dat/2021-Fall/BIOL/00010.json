The emphasis of the course is on data interpretation and experimental design in the context of the ecological concepts we are discussing.  Students will work in small groups on applying basic ecological principles to data interpretation and experimental design.  This course will fulfill the Column C requirement (or elective credit) for the Biology major.  There will be three exams plus a cumulative final exam.  Students will also be evaluated on class discussions.  A separate, optional, 3 credit hour laboratory (Biology 247LW/ENVS 247LW) is associated with this course.  The lab is not required.  Prerequisites: Biology 142 and Biology 142L.",
