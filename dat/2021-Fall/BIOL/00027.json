Turns out that students often have misconceptions, outdated ideas, and bad habits (#cram, #all-nighter) that cause them to waste time, limit learning, and hurt performance (i.e., grades).  Teaching in the sciences is especially challenging; yet, we can use pedagogy science (a.k.a. education research) to guide our plans.  After college, you will probably use some techniques of training/teaching in whatever career you choose.  This will prepare you for that, but also make you a better scientist.",
