    "class_notes": "This course aims to introduce students to a growing subfield of applied linguistics that has emerged in recent decades in order to further explain the human faculty for language.  By treating prior language experience as a variable to be manipulated, linguists seek to better understand the totality of factors at play.  But in what ways, exactly, does the acquisition of a third language (L3) differ from that of a second?  What sorts of advantages are conferred upon bilinguals and multilinguals while learning an additional language, and what precise role do prior-learned languages play in the process?  In this course, students will examine how empirical research involving either Spanish or Portuguese has been used to gain insight into the phenomenon of L3 acquisition.  Taught in Spanish, the course features a number of writing assignments throughout the semester, including a final paper in which students will present their own research design for a prospective L3 study.  In preparation, students will be required to analyze and critique two scientific studies throughout the semester which they will be in charge of presenting to the class.  Course readings will be in Spanish or English, and will be drawn from a broad range of research perspectives.\nPREREQUISITES: At least one foundational course (SPAN 300-318W) is required of all students.",
