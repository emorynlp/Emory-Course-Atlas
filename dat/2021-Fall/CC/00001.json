    "course_description": "In this course, students are introduced to the cross-disciplinary fields of memory and trauma studies. We will focus on the connection between collective group remembrances and religion to assess how constructions and reconstructions of past memories serve as resources of redemption for social groups who have faced persecution. Interdisciplinary readings will draw upon sociology, anthropology, history, and theology to inform students about select historical social atrocities and to encourage learners to witness to the traumatic experiences and legacies of these social groups.
