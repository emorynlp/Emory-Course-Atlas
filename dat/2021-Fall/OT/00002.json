    "course_description": "The OT can seem strange, even disturbing. How do we make sense of texts that portray God as wrathful or relate to all of the laws & rituals? How can we respond to portrayals of women, foreigners, immigrants, & strangers? What do we make of topics like purity, holiness, justice, lament, & sabbath in light of today's realities?\nThis course will make a case for how & why your effectiveness in ministry hinges on your diligent & committed attention to the OT. Emphasis will be placed on asking honest & difficult questions about the meaning of the text.",
