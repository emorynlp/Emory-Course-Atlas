    "class_notes": "\"A possession for all time\" \nSo the Athenian Thucydides described his narrative of the war between the Athenians and the Peloponnesians, a war that he believed was a great war and more worthy of recording that any that had preceded it.  The course focuses on Book 2 of Thucydides' text, including the Funeral oration delivered by Pericles, the description of the plague that hit Athens in the following summer, and the dramatic story of the siege of Plataea.  Emphasis is on both the careful reading of the Greek text and the appreciation of its historical context and influence.\n \nTexts:\nJeffrey Rusten, Thucydides Book 2 (Cambridge 1989)\nW.R.
