Russian literature developed side by side with the revolutionary events of the century and left its historiography, which competes in intensity, uniqueness, and power of imaginative geniuses with some of the greatest works written in any time or place. In this class, the students will be introduced to this cultural maelstrom, starting with Tolstoy's and Chekhov's realistic assessment of Russian society and including some of the most notable writers of the 20th c., such as Bulgakov, Nabokov and Solzhenitsyn.\nParticulars: No knowledge of Russian required.
