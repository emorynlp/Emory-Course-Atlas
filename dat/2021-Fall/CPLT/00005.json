For Latin American societies, and for the democratic project born with the independence from the British monarchy, this study acquires particular importance as we consider populism, figures of political charisma and the media saturated environment in which we live. Particular attention will be paid to political figures such as Eva Perón, Ché Guevara, John F. Kennedy, and others.\nParticulars: Two papers, 1 midterm, textual commentaries, and oral reports.",
