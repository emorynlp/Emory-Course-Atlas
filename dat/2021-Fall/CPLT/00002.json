How do we measure worth? What does it mean to live a good life; what constitutes goodness and on what grounds do we judge? This course takes up such questions by examining some of the ways that texts and images tell stories about people's lives. We will consider biographies in a variety of forms and media that represent people's lives as individuals and members of their respective communities. Biographies raise fundamental questions about the human condition, about love and loss, aspirations and disappointments, courage, pride, and shame. Yet, while they are stories of others, biographies also hold up a mirror to ourselves: What shaped us and who are we becoming? What are we proud of and what do we regret? How well do we know ourselves and can we ever really know another?",
