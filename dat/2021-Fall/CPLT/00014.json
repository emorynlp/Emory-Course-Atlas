Maybe a scene of some aristocratic figures scattered around a drawing room - perhaps women, almost certainly white. What if we were to understand the label \"British\" more expansively? What if we were to take into account what had to be excluded in order to create one particular version of British national identity? In this course, we will read several canonical British literary texts from the eighteenth century to the present alongside lesser-known works by writers from across the British empire (primarily the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean). We will take seriously the British empire as a force that established and continues to assert its national and cultural boundaries through the violent exclusion and othering of particular internal citizens and external subjects.\n\n\nTheoretical texts might include Anderson, Banerjee, Gikandi, Catherine and Stuart Hall, Hobsbawm, Makdisi, Said, and Spivak.\nSame as ENG 389",
