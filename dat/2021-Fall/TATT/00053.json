The defining characteristic of this position across all departments and programs is a controlled, carefully monitored initial teaching opportunity. A teaching assistant may be responsible for 10 to 12 hours per week of discussion or laboratory supervision.",
    "course_description": "The teaching associateship advances the graduate student to a teaching opportunity with greater responsibility than the teaching assistantship. Most often the teaching associate will co-teach a course with a faculty member. In many departments, the graduate student and faculty cooperate on all aspects of a course, from syllabus design to final grading. Occasionally, a teaching associate takes full responsibility for an entire class. Students fulfill teaching associate duties as the final mandatory stage of TATTO.",
