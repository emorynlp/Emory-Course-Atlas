This course presents measures of efficiency of estimating functions; methods to produce efficient estimating functions using orthogonal projection theory; modern methods to reduce the sensitivity of an estimating function to nuisance parameters; artificial likelihood functions to accompany estimating functions; and model selection issues. Applications from biomedical studies are used to illustrate the concepts discussed in class. Prerequisites: BIOS 711 or permission of instructor; some knowledge of statistical computing will be needed to complete the final project.",
