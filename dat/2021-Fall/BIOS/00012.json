This course aims to develop basic understanding of statistical concepts and methods related to the analysis of survival data. The concepts to be introduced include survival functions, hazard rates, types of censoring and truncation. Methods of focus are life table, Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimates, log-rank tests, Cox regression. models, and parametric regression models. Students will learn how to implement standard survival analysis methods using SAS or R and appropriately interpret results. Examples and homework assignments based on real life data will give students the opportunity to analyze survival data and produce reports of their methods, results and conclusions.",
