Spatial EPI includes both the characterization of the geographic distribution of disease, and the investigation of the role of spatially structured processes/exposures as determinants of disease in populations. Upon completion, students will be able to evaluate epidemiologic research using common spatial analytic approaches; match appropriate methods to specific epidemiologic needs or questions; prepare effective visualizations of spatial data; conduct statistical cluster or autocorrelation analysis; estimate model-based disease risk maps; and conduct basic exploratory spatial regression.",
