    "course_description": "This course is an introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics for bivariate and multivariate analyses. The course will help you understand statistics reported in social science publications and in the news media, as well as help you conduct original research. The overall goal is to increase your statistical literacy - your ability to create, interpret, and critically evaluate statistical evidence. This is a set of skills that you will find highly useful in your current academic life and in your future career. It is also a valuable set of skills for virtually everyone in modern society, as statistical knowledge (and numerical literacy more broadly) is key for making sense of the growing amounts of information that we encounter in a digital world.",
