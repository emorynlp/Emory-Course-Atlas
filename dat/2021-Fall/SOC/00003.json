How do conservatives address major public issues? And in view of recent social and political change, what kind of future does conservatism have in America? This seminar aims to answer such questions by discussing conservative texts, studying conservatives and their organizations, and debating conservative approaches to public policy. The seminar will address a variety of issues, ranging from economic and social policy to constitutional law and health care to immigration and foreign affairs. It is open to students of all persuasions who are interested in serious engagement with conservative ideas and policies.",
