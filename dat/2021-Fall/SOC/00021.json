    "class_notes": "Complete Topic - The Meaning of Work: Money, Power, Purpose.\nThis course will use a sociology of culture approach to explore how the notion of 'work' is a social construction of reality. The course proceeds in three sections:\n1) Narratives of work meaning: The American Dream (Money)\nWe explore the meaning of work through the societal narrative of  \"The American Dream.\" We consider how this narrative contains major theoretical and philosophical views on the definition and meaning of 'work', particularly around notions of money. We also look at counter-narratives.\n2) Realities of work meaning: Gender, Race, and Class (Power)\nWe study how work is socially constructed around different groups, particularly gender, race, and social class. We look at sociological research that shows how these cultural meanings are embedded in power structures in the U.S. \n3) Creating work meaning: Purpose\nWe explore issues of organizational culture and how workers create meaning at work. We also look at how individuals create meaning in their own work and through work identities.\nAssignments: In-class Small Group Work (graded individually, not as a group), Two Critical Thinking Papers (5-6 pages each) and one Final Paper (8-12 pages).
