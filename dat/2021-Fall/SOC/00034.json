    "course_description": "Sociological theory sometimes has the unfortunate reputation of being (a) removed from empirical matters and (b) done by people who are now long dead. That reputation cannot be further from the truth. In fact, sociological theory remains vibrant in the present and, in both its classical and contemporary formulations, it has remained tied to understanding empirically the world in which we live. In this seminar, we will focus on recent streams of thought within sociological theory -- starting with such 20th century sociologists as W.E.B. Du Bois and working our way to such living sociologists as Viviana Zelizer. In the process, we will see how sociological theory connects to such fundamental concerns as race and racism, identity, commercialization and the expanding digital world.",
