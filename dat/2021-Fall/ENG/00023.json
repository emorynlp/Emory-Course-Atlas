    "class_notes": "This course will explore some of the most important American novels of the twentieth century from historical, stylistic, and theoretical perspectives. In addition to considering the novel as a form, we will examine how our authors react to and comment on their social and political contexts. Through discussions of topics including race, sexuality, immigration, regional difference, economics, globalization, and war, we will think through what makes these novels uniquely American and what they can teach us about our current understandings of American identity. Texts will include novels by Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, William Faulkner, James Baldwin, and Toni Morrison. We will practice critical and creative responses to literature with a close reading, a comparative analysis, a historical lens paper, and a short story.",
