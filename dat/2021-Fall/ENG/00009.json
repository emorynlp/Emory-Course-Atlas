How do we understand queer acts throughout history, before the concept of sexual orientation emerged? How do literature and art, through clandestine codes and symbolism, transmit knowledge of a queer lineage and queer practices? To explore these questions and others, we will read across a broad range of literature from the Greeks to the present day. Students will be expected to participate in class discussions, and to complete course assignments including weekly reading responses, a close reading exercise, and two critical essays. Likely course texts include Sappho, Plato, Thomas Mann, Nella Larsen, James Baldwin, Anne Carson, Alison Bechdel and Andrea Lawlor.",
