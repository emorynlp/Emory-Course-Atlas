    "class_notes": "Course Topic: Poetry and Mourning--History of the English Elegy\n\n\nElegy names a lament for the dead, a song of mourning. Yet throughout its history it has often channeled the fierce emotionalism associated with lamentation and mourning into highly stylized and artificial language. And, in a tradition going back to Greek and Roman antiquity, many poets wrote elegies for the earlier poets who preceded them as a way to stage themselves as the inheritors of the poet's role even as they brought new materials and new themes to the elegiac genre. In this class we will explore these and other paradoxes across the long history of elegy in the English language beginning in the early modern period and concluding with the 21st century.",
