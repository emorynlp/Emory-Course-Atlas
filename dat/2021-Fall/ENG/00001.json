    "class_notes": "Course Topic: Dystopias: Hers and His-A number of critics have described our contemporary era as a golden age for the genre of dystopian fiction. The result is that, as one commentator puts it, \"there's a book for every type of modern dread.\" Particularly notable in this current dystopic outpouring has been the influence of women writers, in contrast to the earlier dystopias composed mainly by men.\nThis course juxtaposes 2 classic dystopias by male writers, Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World, with 4 novels by contemporary women writers to explore how works by Ma, Atwood, Butler, and Newitz are reshaping the genre. Whether post-apocalyptic, post-pandemic, or post-political, the imaginative societies envisioned by these writers pose crucial questions about where the real dangers lie for our future, and our present, through their groundbreaking dystopic novels.\nRequirements are class attendance and informed participation, regular response paragraphs, and two short papers, one potentially optional.\nNote: Please email the instructor (martine.brownley@emory.edu) with any questions or for further information about this course.",
