    "class_notes": "In this survey of twentieth-century British novelists, we will explore a wide range of literary styles and strategies, charting the novel's development through a period of rapid social and political change in which the very idea of what Britain represented, as a nation, an empire, an identity, was under constant revision. Our focus will be on how this sense of change is represented, reflected, and even created by the new artistic and narrative forms of the modernist era. While the authors on our syllabus often addressed large-scale subjects, they most often did so through a particular focus on the individual, demonstrating the variability and specificity of personal experience. Topics of discussion will include experimental representations of consciousness and the passage of time; shifting conceptions of gender, race, and class; the impact of war and the writing of memory; the figures of the artist, the adventurer, and the lover; and the relationships among city, country, and the world at large.\nRequirements include three 5-7 papers, a final exam, and participation in discussions. Texts may include: Joseph Conrad, The Secret Agent; Ford Madox Ford, The Good Soldier; D. H. Lawrence, Lady Chatterley's Lover, E. M. Forster, A Passage to India; Virginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse; Samuel Selvon, The Lonely Londoners; Muriel Spark, The Girls of Slender Means; Jeanette Winterson, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit; Hanif Kureishi, The Buddha of Suburbia.",
