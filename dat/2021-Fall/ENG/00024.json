We will read texts by Louise Erdrich, Deborah Miranda, Tommy Pico, Craig Womack, Beth Brant, Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm, and others. Readings will include fiction, poetry, and non-fiction. We will also regularly engage Native news media sources. These texts will lead us to discuss issues of sexual violence, colonialism, and heteropatriarchy impacting Indigenous people. They will also draw our attention to positive experiences of Indigenous sexuality and gender expression. Course requirements include reading, participation in class discussion, informal writing assignments, a group presentation, one short paper, one long paper, a midterm, and a final exam.",
