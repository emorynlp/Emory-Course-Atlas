We will privilege stories as a means to understand human beings when they are sick, weak, angry, incompetent, insane, blind, infected, dying, suffering, and so on. In short, those who are convalescent are our interest. We will read stories about and by those who attempt(ed) to treat them, or those inspired to understand them. Most importantly, we will practice how to write about illness following the precedents set by some of these authors with the goal of using your own knowledge to further refine a critical skill for your careers.",
