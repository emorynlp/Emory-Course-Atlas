    "class_notes": "Shakespeare and Early Modern Animal Studies\nWhat does it mean that Shakespearean stages were in close proximity to sites of nonhuman animal gatherings, from bear-baiting to meat markets? What does it mean that animal blood and parts were commonly used as props and that animal skins and furs were routinely worn by the stage's all-male actors?   In this seminar we'll consider such questions as we read a range of dramas by Shakespeare and his contemporaries (for example, Shakespeare's Two Gentlemen of Verona, Titus Andronicus, and  The Winter's Tale, and  Ben Jonson's Bartholomew Fair and John Webster's The White Devil).  In reading these texts, we will explore how they  conjure up animality (whether  through  figurative language, stage practices, or material objects) and how animality may be linked to early modern English narratives about  gender, sexuality, and race. In addition, we will put these literary works in conversation with other early modern animal texts from such genres as the travel narrative, bestiary, hunting treatise, and dietary.",
