Over the course of this semester, we will begin with this question and discover the constellation of practices that shaped the making of the black writing tradition. Not only will we read these writings, we will also study the cultural impact of their composition, illustration, publishing, printing, typesetting, and distribution. Equally as important to the life of black print culture were the intellectual exchanges made possible by black literary societies, black lending libraries, and the early black press, as our archival work will reveal. Our coursework will lead to a greater appreciation of black literary and cultural creativity.",
