    "class_notes": "Course Topic: Southern Women Writers- This course will explore works by major women writers of the American South. Through readings from the late nineteenth century through the contemporary era, we will familiarize ourselves with the thematic and formal elements that characterize southern women's literature, while thinking about ways these authors challenge assumptions about southern identity in their representations of gender, sexuality, and race. We will consider, as well, how the novels we'll read reflect women's experiences of coming of age in the South as affected by the particular constraints and ideals of southern culture. Texts will include novels by Kate Chopin, Ellen Glasgow, Carson McCullers, Zora Neale Hurston, and Monique Truong. We will practice critical and creative responses to literature with a close reading, a comparative analysis, a short story, and a research paper.",
