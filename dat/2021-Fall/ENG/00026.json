    "class_notes": "Across the university, data science is changing how we think about knowledge. Can it change how we think about literature, too? Scholars have begun gathering data to better understand how white supremacy reproduces itself in the publishing industry in the United States. Data on which poets win which prizes and who serves on the prize committees shows how important interpersonal relationships have been to the history of poetic prestige. Bestseller lists tell us a lot about how popularity has changed over time. \n \nData and the internet are already changing how writers write. In this course, students might read Instagram poets and Twitter fiction alongside new 'internet' novels by Patricia Lockwood and Lauren Oyler.  \n \nNo experience with computer programming or data science necessary.",
