Reading its key texts and studying its varied communities, we explore Christianity's historical developments up to the early modern period (i.e., the 1500s), as well as its cross-cultural expressions. We attend especially to the political contexts of what is now the world's most populous religion, its emergence as an anti-imperial movement in first-century Palestine and early spread into Asia and Africa, its eventual alliance with the Roman Empire and consolidations in Europe, and its modern-era expansion into the Americas and other colonized lands. No prior knowledge of, experience with, or commitments to Christianity are presupposed or necessary to do well in this course.",
