What sorts of lives are good lives?  How does goodness relate to flourishing?  \nOur approach will be broadly philosophical. We will read and discuss together a range of texts as we pursue our questions about goodness, ethics, and forms of life.  Some texts will be philosophical and theological, some biographical, some literary, some filmic.   \nThis is a discussion class: we are in this together, and we learn from one another as well as from our readings.  Your attendance and participation are essential to the success of this course.",
