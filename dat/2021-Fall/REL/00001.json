There are articles about Hindu nationalists and Christian evangelicals, and religious arguments about sex, death, and civil and human rights. There are arguments about religious symbols such as the Ten Commandments or cartoons of Muhammad. Religion is infused in political rhetoric. Presidents are sworn in with their hand on a Bible. Along with these religious traditions and institutions that are in the news, phenomena that are not usually considered religious such as Greek life, sporting events, and popular culture can also be seen through the lens of religion.\n \nThis course introduces classic themes and topics in the study of religion in the context of contemporary issues such as terrorism, imperialism, race in America, and college life. The course aims to make the conceptual resources of the study of religion available for understanding and critiquing contemporary life.",
