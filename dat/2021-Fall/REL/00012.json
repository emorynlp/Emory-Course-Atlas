    "class_notes": "This course satisfies the new Religion major requirement: Tradition-Jainism\nThis course introduces students to the philosophy and ritual practices of a religious tradition from India whose main teaching is nonviolence to all living beings: Jainism. The course is organized historically, beginning with the earliest texts from over 2,000 years ago, and ending with an examination of present-day practices, from the promotion of vegetarianism to debates about the legality of the Jain fast to death. Jains believe that every living being, from an insect to a god, has a soul with infinite knowledge and bliss. The goal of every Jain is to realize this infinite knowledge and bliss and escape the cycle of rebirth by destroying karma through nonviolence, meditation, and limiting possessions. This course will examine the texts, objects, and practices that relate to this path to liberation. Jainism continues to develop in conversation with Buddhism and Hinduism, so we will spend a significant amount of time examining these traditions as well. Along the way, we will make a trip to the Jain temple in Atlanta, make extensive use of the collection of Jain sculptures and paintings at the Carlos Museum, and virtually connect with Jain monks and nuns living in India.",
