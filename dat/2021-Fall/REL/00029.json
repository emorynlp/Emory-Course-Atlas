While there are certainly benefits to interdisciplinary scholarship, such approaches also pose a unique set of challenges. The success of interdisciplinary scholarship depends on the scholar's ability to communicate to audiences who often use different nomenclature, evidence, and analytical methods. A failure to appreciate these challenges can lead to attempts at interdisciplinary scholarship that are reductive, one-sided, vague, or confused. In this course, students will survey the interdisciplinary field of Law and Religion. The course will begin by discussing the nature of the field known as Law and Religion. What areas of inquiry constitute this field? What do we mean when we talk about 'law' and 'religion'? \nThis course is recommended for students in advance of a significant writing project in Law and Religion, including a journal comment, major seminar paper, or thesis",
