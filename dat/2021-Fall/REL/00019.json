Tied, in its own self-understanding, to a specific people that never numbered more than a few million, it nevertheless developed universalistic ideas that profoundly affected Christianity and Islam - two traditions that include billions of people around the world.  In this course, we will begin with the Hebrew Bible - one of the main texts that helped shape Christian and European civilization - and see how its central concepts and narratives evolved and were interpreted over the next 25 centuries as Jews possessed power and faced persecution, pondered God and struggled with nature and reality.  The outcome is a rich panoply of religious practice, sacred texts and inspired ideas that have made Judaism an enduring tradition.)",
