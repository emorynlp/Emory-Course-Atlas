    "course_description": "This course offers academic support to participants within a small group setting. The group meets once a week for hour long seminars on subjects related to seminary life: managing one's schedule, persevering through adversity, maturing as a critical thinker, developing habits of study, preparing for essay tests, and other relevant topics. ADVANCE is not a remedial program; rather, it provides students with a supplemental form of academic support. ADVANCE seeks to cultivate confidence by helping students structure their own learning, by stimulating critical discussion and by promoting mutual support and accountability. Using material drawn directly from course assignments, ADVANCE instructors companion students as they develop strategies necessary for successful navigation of coursework. In this collaborative setting, students will challenge, encourage, and support one another through the first semester.",
