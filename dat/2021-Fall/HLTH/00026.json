As audio storytelling grows in popularity through podcasts and voice-recognition devices, communicators of all types need to know the best ways to create and produce content, whether as aspiring scientists, policymakers, science communicators, physicians, health professionals or journalists. Today's most effective and entertaining podcasts use the same basic tenets of identifying and outlining a story, conducting research and interviews, crafting an argument, organizing a narrative and gathering quality audio. In this class, taught by two national health journalists, students will produce written and audio pieces suitable for publication and analyze current news stories and podcasts to understand the shared tenets of storytelling, reporting and writing.",
