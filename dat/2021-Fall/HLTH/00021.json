Along with looking closely at several psychiatric diagnoses, such as schizophrenia, autism, depression, and bipolar disorder as they are represented in various cultural environments, we will be exploring how people experience and interact within various psychiatric healing systems. We will be reading selected articles and chapters from academic journals, books, online resources, and scientific literature. These resources, along with podcasts and classroom discussions, will guide the class in considering the use of Western diagnostic criteria among non-Western cultures.",
