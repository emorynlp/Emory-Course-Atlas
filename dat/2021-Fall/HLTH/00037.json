Drawing on a number of classic and contemporary texts, we consider both the specificity of local medical narratives and the processes, which increasingly link these systems of knowledge and practice. The course queries how presupposed notions of language, communication, narrative, media, and the like provide implicit foundations for producing and naturalizing notions of health, disease, medicine, and the body and their associated practices and materialities. Topics covered include narrative production; local theories of disease causation and healing efficacy; narratives of embodiment; medicalization; structural violence; the meanings and effects of new medical technologies; and global health.) \nTexts:Provided by instructor.\nPrerequisites:At least one foundational course (SPAN 300- 318) or permission from instructor",
