Through a combination of presentations, readings, and discussion of field-experiences, this course engages multiple dimensions of \"development practice,\" interrogating how specific methodological and logistical necessities shape the ways that organizations, projects, and project personnel interact with beneficiaries, policies and development discourses. By collaboratively interrogating each other's experiences, this course helps students to understand and navigate both the opportunities and constraints that emerge in the daily doing of development practice.",
