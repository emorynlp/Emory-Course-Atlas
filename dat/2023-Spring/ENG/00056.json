    "class_notes": "(Complete Topic - Quantitative Literary Analysis: Theory and Practice)\n(One of the primary strands of digital humanities scholarship is quantitative literary analysis: the use of quantitative (and other digital) methods to study literary texts. These practices raise many major questions: What does large-scale analysis reveal about literature that cannot be discerned by reading alone? What happens when literary texts are converted into numbers, as they must be for any quantitative analysis to take place? What does it mean, both ethically and intellectually, to borrow methods developed in the sciences and/or from industry for literary and cultural studies scholarship? And what of the core concerns of literary and cultural studies? This course will take on these questions in both theory and practice, first by reading and discussing key digital humanities texts that explore these questions, and then, as a class, thinking through possible projects in the area of quantitative literary studies that might intervene. The course will culminate in final projects undertaken in small groups, consisting of both graduate students in English (and related programs) and advanced undergraduates in QTM, which demonstrate how quantitative analysis can contribute to current scholarly conversations in the field of literary studies and beyond, as well as what those demonstrations reveal about the methods, infrastructure, and conceptual frameworks of quantitative and computational analysis.)",
