    "class_notes": "Topic: Cute Studies (This course critically examines the aesthetics of cuteness in the context of the politics of race, gender, sexuality, disability, and age, with a special focus on the globalization of Japanese kawaii (\"cute\") culture and its impact on Asian diasporas. In its associations with the small, soft, and simple, cuteness is an aesthetic category intimately bound up in differences of power. Over the past few decades, this aesthetic has been freshly emerging as a global phenomenon in relation to new technologies and the spread of Japanese popular culture.\nIn this course, we will study literary texts and cultural objects that engage the aesthetic to unpack how cuteness commodifies social difference and distills complex political dynamics within seemingly trivial and mundane aspects of everyday life. We will situate its contemporary popularity in longer histories of imperialism and commodity capitalism, as well as cultural conceptions of Asian people, women, children, and animals. \nTopics to be discussed will include: the historical emergence of cuteness and kawaii; childhood innocence and nostalgia; caricature and animation; globalization and soft power; toys and play; pets and domesticated animals; food and eating; Japanophilia; pink as a cute color; cute robots and digital aesthetics; the ties between the cute, cool, campy, sexy, and uncanny; cuteness's uptake in contemporary literature and art; cuteness's potential for healing and care.)",
