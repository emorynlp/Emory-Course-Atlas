    "class_notes": "This course will introduce students to major works of British literature dating from the death of Elizabeth in 1603 to the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. We will adopt a broadly historicist approach, devoting special attention to the relation between the period's literature and the politics of the English Civil War (1642-1651). This approach, however, will not be at the expense of attention to the formal and thematic qualities of individual works. We will read works by John Donne, George Herbert, Ben Jonson, Robert Herrick, Katherine Phillips, Margaret Cavendish, Francis Bacon, John Milton, and others. Topics to be considered include the English Civil War, Metaphysical and Cavalier Poetry, gender relations in the seventeenth century, and the rise of empirical science.",
