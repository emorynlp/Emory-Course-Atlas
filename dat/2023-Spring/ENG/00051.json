    "class_notes": "(Walter Mignolo claims that \"coloniality is still with us: there is no `post\" from decolonial perspectives.\" Moreover, Fanon's warnings against \"colonialism in its new forms,\" remain urgent. Through readings in literature and theory, we will examine the afterlife of colonialism as both systemic and scattershot. Colonization's impact on political, sexual, and biocultural identities, its disruption of habitats and ecosocial relations, and its pernicious legacies of racism are counterbalanced by sharp critique and subversively decolonial modes of reading and writing by postcolonial authors and theorists. Genres explored include the traditional as well as Zines, FB feed, vernacular Englishes, blogposts, TED talks, fabulography, visual art\n \nAuthors will be chosen from the following selection of black British, Asian, and African authors: Novuyo Rosa Tshuma, Ngugi, Chakrabarty, Namwali Serpell, Arundhati Roy, Bulawayo, Amitav Ghosh, Teju Cole, Evaristo (essay), Chitra Ganesh, Adichie, Warsan Shire",
