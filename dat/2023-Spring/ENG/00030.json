    "class_notes": "Emory's Stuart A. Rose Library is home to one of the strongest collections of Irish literature outside of Ireland.  In this course, we will delve into the work of several Irish writers to examine the drafts, letters, photographs and historical contexts of their archives.  Beginning with W.B Yeats and his circle, we will focus on the Easter Rising of 1916 and Yeats's famous poem commemorating the event.  In the second half of the course, we will study the work of Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney and selected archives of contemporary Irish poetry. In each case, we will investigate the story of these archives, the journey from first draft to finished piece and the curation of exhibitions of literary material.",
