In what way is literature a \"limit-case\" of language, that is, a way of taking language to the very limits of what it can say or do? In this seminar we will explore a number of literary and theoretical texts that reflect directly on these questions. In doing so, we will consider how such texts often pose a challenge to the clear generic definitions through which we usually distinguish literature and theory, but also through which we make other generic distinctions such as fiction and history, poetry and prose, or even medicine and myth. At the limits of language, we will be reading hybrid  works in which different kinds of language come together and break apart in peculiar and challenging combinations' works that can be read, for example, as both philosophical argument and autobiographical novel or as both critical commentary and political thriller.\nSince we will be reading several works in translation, we will also give special attention to how literary language seems to resist translation and what that may suggest about the specificity of the literary and the \"limits\" of language.\nProvisional Particulars: three short formal essays; oral presentation; weekly responses to readings; class discussion\n\n\nSince we will be reading several works in translation, we will also give special attention to how literary language seems to resist translation and what that may suggest about the specificity of the literary and the \"limits\" of language.\nProvisional Particulars: three short formal essays; oral presentation; weekly responses to readings; class discussion",
