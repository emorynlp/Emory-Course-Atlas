They will pay attention to the ways that writers such as Ama Ata Aidoo, Lorraine Hansberry, Warsan Shire, Monica Arac de Nyeko, Nawal el Saadawi, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Mariama Ba, etc use their creative work to critique postcolonial nationalism, white supremacy, colonialism, sexism and sexist exploitation in an African continental and diaspora context. Students will write two papers, a shorter one (4 - 5 pages), handed in the middle of the semester, and a longer final paper handed in at the end of the semester (8 - 10 pages).",
