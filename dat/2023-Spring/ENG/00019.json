This course surveys this period through the writings of Johnson and through his life as portrayed by James Boswell, the first and greatest of literary biographers, and by Hester Lynch Piozzi's Anecdotes. Because Johnson, Boswell, and Piozzi refused to separate literature from everyday life and practical concerns and were deeply involved in the great events and issues of their times, this course provides a general overview of social and cultural life in England during the period from 1740 to 1798, including its history, politics, art, and mores. \nRequirements are class attendance and participation, with a combination of short essays and exams.)",
