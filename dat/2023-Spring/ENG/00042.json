    "class_notes": "(Complete Topic - Modernity and the British Countryside)\n(Most critical understandings of modernity assume that social and cultural progress emanates from urban spaces. In this course, we will read British novels that focus on the countryside and village life from the late Victorian period through modernism and the present day, and we will find so much more than charm and nostalgia. Covering a stylistic range that includes realism, impressionism, satire, and the neo-gothic, our texts will help us investigate how rural communities both reflect and produce change, and how they sometimes contain the most radical energies of their time. We will examine how literary fiction invokes landscape and a sense of place, how new forms of art emerge from some of Britain's oldest settings, how the environmental movement intersects with the countryside novel, and how the genre addresses heritage, class, race, gender, sexuality, and belonging.\nTexts include some (not all!) of the following: Hardy, Far From the Madding Crowd; Lawrence, Lady Chatterley's Lover; Gibbons, Cold Comfort Farm; Woolf, Between the Acts; Forster, Maurice; Warner, Lolly Willowes; Lively, Heat Wave; Carr, A Month in the Country; Chatwin, On the Black Hill; Swift, Waterland; Barnes.
