We will consider the way that literary genres such as the love poem, the wedding masque, and the nursery tale function within the reproductive economy. We will also examine the changes that take place in the household and family during our period, a time when communal households and arranged marriages remained common but nuclear families and the ideal of companionate marriage were becoming more prevalent. The course will begin with a set of readings in feminist criticism, economics, and history that will provide a reproductive economy. We will then move into a survey of early modern poetry, drama, and prose, including writings by Shakespeare, Wroth, and Milton and lesser-known texts such as midwifery manuals and conduct books.",
