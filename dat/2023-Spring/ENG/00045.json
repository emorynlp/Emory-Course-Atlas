It will investigate the concrete details of a substantial portion of each writer's work in both major genres in order to begin to establish some critical understanding of their relations, affordances, powers, limitations, and inter-penetrations. Jude the Obscure, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Cane and major poems by each author will be studied in detail. Students will compose a lively argumentative essay that will engage with published discourse on genre, sub-genre, form, prosody, narrative, and prose poetics.)",
