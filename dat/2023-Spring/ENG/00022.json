    "class_notes": "The harms and injuries of European colonialism inflicted on colonial landscapes, bodies, and minds remain richly in evidence as we read postcolonial literature and theory. How does the empire write back to indict and challenge the legacies of colonialism?  How do writers resist, critique, and untangle the violence inflected by colonialism? How do we begin to decolonize the mind and the body in terms of our educational systems, bodily practices and lifestyles, and the aggressive propagation of capitalist personhood as the model for global citizenship? This course will introduce students to writers and theorists who respond to the intricate legacies of capitalism and colonialism, and point toward decolonial futures.\n \nAuthors include Adichie, Kandasami, Cole, Dangarembga, Bulowayo, Lahiri",
