This course will wrestle with the challenges of imagining both the slow violence of environmental catastrophe and alternatives to it. We will explore concepts of the Anthropocene, utopia, environmental justice, and Afrofuturism through novels by Ursula K. Le Guin, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Octavia E. Butler, as well as through essays, graphic narrative, short stories, and film. As this is a Continuing Writing course, there will be four writing assignments, in addition to informal writing on a course blog, but no exams.",
