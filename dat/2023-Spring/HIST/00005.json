Our focus will be on the recent past, with an emphasis on the case of Mexico and the Andean nations of South America. We will read historical and scholarly texts alongside poetry, literature, and film produced by and about Native peoples. Our aim is to better understand the role of Indigenous peoples in confronting the major challenges of our time: the control and distribution of vital resources like land and water, and the recognition of the dignity of all peoples, including those who have been historically colonized and dispossessed. Assessments include: Attendance and class participation: 20%; Discussion facilitation: 5%; Source presentations: 15%; three essays (two of which are 1000 words each, and a final essay of 2000 words: 15%; 15%; 30%).",
