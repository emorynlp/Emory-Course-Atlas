While political and military history are a big part of the story, this course will not take the wars of conquest approach to examining the Roman world, but will look to the material evidence of Roman culture to see what we can learn from interrogating the art and artifacts of Roman civilization, and what they can tell us about the foundational beliefs and religious practices that shaped the worldview of the Roman peoples. This course will examine life outside the Italian peninsula especially in Egypt, the Middle East, and Britain to learn about the culture and civilization of the provinces, and the way that \"Roman\" came to mean something very different across a vastly diverse empire.)",
