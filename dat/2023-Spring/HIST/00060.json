    "class_notes": "This course introduces students to the historical study of borders and borderlands in Central and Eastern European history from the 17th to the 21st century. With the rise of the modern nation state, borders increasingly defined spatial limits of state power. During the 20th century, war and conquest have frequently redrawn European borders. In the late 20th century, borders changed how they functioned in Western Europe (Schengen), came down in Central Europe (Berlin Wall, Velvet Revolution), and proliferated in Eastern Europe (dissolution of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia). Each new upheaval underscored the point that as spatialized social relations, borderlands may have an afterlife well beyond the states that created them. For instance, a number of our readings will focus on the western borderlands of the Russian Empire and the USSR, today's Ukraine. Students will be able to adapt their final projects in this class to geographic regions of their choice.",
