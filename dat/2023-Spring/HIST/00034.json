Genocide was made a legal term a few years later when the United Nations ratified the Genocide Convention on December 9, 1948, which criminalized `acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. Despite the fact that `genocide is a 20th century term, acts have been committed throughout human history that fit into this legal definition. The purpose of this course is to historicize genocide by exploring examples of genocide before the existence of this term. We will examine instances of genocide from Ancient times to the present that took place all over the world: in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. We will also discuss different forms of genocide: cultural, religious, political, and racial. By the end of the course students will have a greater understanding of what defines genocide and how this modern term can be applied to events of the past. \nGrading structure: Participation: 20%; Short writing assignments: 30%; Two exams: 20%; Final research project & presentation: 30%\nThis course is appropriate for first year students.)",
