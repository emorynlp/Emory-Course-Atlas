At the same time, they have often become the source of discord, as different groups disagreed over what and who should be remembered as heroic and exemplary. This course will explore some of these debates by focusing on the representation of exemplary lives in the region through a variety of means, including photography, monuments, museums, archives, ceremonials, and rituals. Among the topics to be addressed are: modernity, nation building, social rebellion, and accountability.)",
