The Kerner Commission, formally titled the National Advisory Committee on Civil Disorders, was established in 1967 by President Lyndon Johnson to study the causes of civil disorder in American cities in the 1960s and to provide recommendations for the future.  Atlanta was one of more than a dozen cities where the Commission sent a team of investigators to interview politicians, law enforcement officials, business leaders, community activists, and other leaders.  Documents from that investigation, housed in the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, have been digitized and will serve as the core of the historical materials with which this class will engage.  Student writing assignments will be designed to edit, contextualize, and analyze these documents for the development of and potential inclusion in the digital humanities project now under construction.  To help with this work, we will read secondary material related to both the history of Atlanta in the twentieth century and the broader historiography on twentieth century American urban history and the history of race, crime, and policing in modern America.",
