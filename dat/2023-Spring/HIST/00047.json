How did the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, and Byzantines encounter plague, and what happened to their social and religious world as a result? How did the upheaval of plague affect the lives of women and other disenfranchised members of society? We will look at the stories and accounts of those who lived through these times, and we will also examine the art and artifacts of the time period in order to evaluate material evidence along with textual narratives. This was also a period of great movement and migration, as peoples from the north and the east migrated to the Mediterranean world. How were these movements of people accommodated, and how did they change the world they encountered?)",
