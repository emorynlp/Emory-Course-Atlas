Readings will take us chronologically and thematically from the mid 19th through early 21st centuries as we place the South in conversation with the (trans)national processes that would come to diversify the region. Throughout the semester we will consider how race, ethnicity, and migration specifically have shaped the region in relation to labor, politics, culture, and historical memory.",
