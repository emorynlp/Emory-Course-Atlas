    "class_notes": "One cannot discuss the history of Latin America without discussing its prehispanic cultures, colonialism, empires, the Catholic Church, borders, patriarchy, capitalism, socialism, social movements, migration, and the people who inhabit the region. We must also push away from the idea that Latin America is a monolithic region. Its heterogeneity makes it difficult to analyze, discuss, research, teach and understand but this course will tackle these challenges head on. \nThe question of \"what is Latin America'' will figure centrally throughout the course. This is not to say that by the end of the class we will have a class answer but by learning the region's intricate history we will complicate our past understanding of Latin American places, times, and people.",
    "course_description": "This course explores the history of Latin America from European contact to present. Major themes include Latin America's position in a wider world; class, ethnic, and race relations; state-society relations; the making of regional and national identities.",
