An experiential research seminar combining training in historical archival research, engagement with the materials and methods of Native American and Indigenous Studies, and the digital humanities, this course will deepen our understanding of Emory's history in relation to Native American nations of the Southeast and the way that these histories are intertwined with African American history. Our intersectional studies interrogate the entangled histories of slavery and Native American dispossession in the founding of Emory University, recover untold stories of Indigenous and Black lives in Atlanta's early history, and make visible Native American presence(s) in Emory campus life throughout the university's history to the present day. Over the semester, students will produce an original 20-page paper based on a collaborative digital history project.",
