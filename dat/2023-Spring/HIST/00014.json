This course will explore the forms of resistance African people and their descendants have used across Latin America history from the early colonial period through present day. By tracing the complicated history of race and ethnicity from colonial times to now, students will gain a greater understanding of the African presence in Latin America and the ways in which people of African descent have sought upward mobility and challenged systems of exploitation, oppression, and disenfranchisement.",
