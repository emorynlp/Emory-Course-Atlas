It covers peoples' flight from the Third Reich and German-occupied countries, resettlement as an element of Nazi genocidal policies, postwar displacement, and emigration from Europe. Our focus will be on individual experiences of refugees, as well as responses of governments and local communities. We will pay special attention to the US reaction. And we will situate our studies within the survey of global refugee movement in the 20th century, the age of genocide.",
