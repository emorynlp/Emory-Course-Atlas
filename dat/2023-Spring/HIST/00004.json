What are the rights of citizenship and the rights of subjects under imperial rule? What happens to these rights when empire formerly ends? This seminar will explore these questions focusing on Britain in the second half of the 20th century. While British practices of slavery and imperialism have shaped the history of Africans and South Asians for centuries, we will examine the experience of those who have come to identify as Black Britons during the twentieth century.",
