In a society such as New Spain (Mexico) articulated around the defense and propagation of Catholic religion, religious crimes constituted a threatening subversion of the colonial discourse that justified the Spanish presence in Mexico, and a contradictory expression of the social tensions lived in the Spanish colony. This course will look at colonial society through the lens of crime by analyzing some of the main transgressions prosecuted by the Mexican Inquisition between 1520 and 1820, and the specific historical circumstances in which the trials took place. Our goal will be not only to analyze the reasons for inquisitorial repression, but also to disentangle the tensions lived in the social fabric of the colony in light of the classic divides of race, class, and gender.)",
