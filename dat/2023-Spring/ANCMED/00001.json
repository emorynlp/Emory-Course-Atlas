This semester we will read Aristotle's famous book entitled, simply, Politics. In it, Aristotle argues that we are political animals by nature, suggesting that happiness in found in political engagement, not in private isolation. Aristotle explores the notion of the good society and obstacles to realizing the good society. We will also read an analysis of political ambition by Socrates' student Xenophon. Xenophon tells the story of Cyrus the Great, founder of the Persian empire in a book that is both dramatic and philosophically incisive. Evaluation will be based on class participation, papers, and exams.)",
