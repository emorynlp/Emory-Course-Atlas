Beginning with Late Classical masters like Praxiteles and Lysippos, we will consider how foreign rulers instigated an artistic revolution that only intensified with Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic kings that followed. This course will study how the art of the period embraced previously uninteresting, or even inappropriate, themes like beggars, prostitutes, and foreigners even as more traditional subjects like gods, athletes, and rulers were represented in new ways.\nAs a writing-intensive course, over the course of the semester students will compose an argumentative paper as well as a research paper on the topic of their choice. There are no prerequisites for the course, although some familiarity with ancient art is encouraged.  \nArt History major/minor: Division I",
