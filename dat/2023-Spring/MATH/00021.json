Please contact Ms. Taylr Tuggle (taylr.annece.tuggle@emory.edu) for permission. \nThe goal of this class is to provide the necessary mathematical foundations for modern data science.  Topics include numerical linear algebra, image compression, clustering, regression, numerical methods for least-squares problems, large-scale numerical optimization, nonlinear regression, and unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.  The course introduces students to theory and methods for data science, and students get hands-on experience working on examples from a variety of applications.",
