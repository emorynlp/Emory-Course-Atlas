We will explore molecular structure-function relationships that affect neuronal function and thus, behavior. Topics may will include the molecular basis of channel mutations that cause neurological disorders and affect drug efficacy, but other topics of students, choice will also be major components as we explore structure-function relationships of proteins in the CNS. We will use case studies and other active-learning activities to drive our exploration of molecular interactions underlying behavior. Assessments will include student presentations, individual and collaborative quizzes, and other assignments.)\n(Prerequisites: Previous completion of Chem 204 and/or Bio 301 required.
