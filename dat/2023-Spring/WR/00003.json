    "course_description": "This seminar will investigate what is commonly referred to as Socially Engaged Buddhism by focusing on modern social and political movements in both Asia and N. America. In particular, we will study contemporary Buddhist individuals and organizations involved in freedom struggles; peace and reconciliation work; training AIDS, hospice, and prison volunteers; alleviating social and economic injustice; and teaching meditation in non-Buddhist, `secular' settings. Throughout, we will explore how Buddhist philosophies, precepts, practices, and institutions are being selectively adopted and adapted in these various venues. We will also consider the influences that non-Buddhist systems, worldviews, and practices have had on Socially Engaged Buddhist activists and movements around the world. The class typically will include several socially engaged Buddhist guest speakers, the viewing of award-winning films, and a field trip to Nipponzan Myohoji, a local Buddhist temple involved in peace and social justice activism.",
