    "class_notes": "This course zooms into the case of subaltern groups in China ethnic minorities, which are generally overlooked in academic studies and in school curriculum to examine various discourses on ethnic minorities through a multimedia lens and reflect on how this local case is positioned within a global context. \"Ethnic community\", or minzu in Chinese, is a slippery term evoking a series of intricate relationships with race, ethnicity, nationality, and indigeneity. In this course, we will investigate these concepts and relevant theories to understand the complexity of ethnic issues in China. \nEach week by discussing cinematic, literary, photographic, and new media texts, we will closely examine how minorities are identified, appropriated, and consumed and how they simultaneously negotiate with the Han-centric social structure and respond to the impact of globalization. Meanwhile, students will have the chance to examine the global representation of Chinese ethnic minorities in films and other media. There are no textbooks required for this course. All readings and screening materials will be available through Canvas and/or Course Reserves.",
