    "course_description": "This course is designed for students who are in the process of vocational discernment and/or participating in the certificate program for Women, Theology, and Ministry in the MDiv or MTS degree programs. It will explore the call of God using the theological framework of Wesleyan theology and the work of Benedict and Ignatius for providing skills useful in a sustained life of ministry. The course will look at the history and theology of the role of call within the context of ordination and will consider some of the unique issues that surround ordained ministry as well as retention in ministry, particularly for women. This course will also employ the diverse role of creativity for ministry as it employs sustaining models for visual journaling, autobiographical journaling, and other expressive arts.",
