We will examine how Jews have defined themselves socially and politically in a number of historical and geographical settings, how Jewish theology and religious practice have been shaped and transformed, and how Jews have interacted with and responded to the societies in which they have lived. A central question during the ancient period will be, what was \"Judaism\" and\nhow did it emerge out of the diverse religious landscape of antiquity? The medieval period will focus on the interface between Jewish communities and the states or empires in which they lived.",
