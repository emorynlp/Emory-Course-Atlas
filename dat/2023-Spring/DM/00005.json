    "course_description": "Prerequisite: DM700. (Faculty) This course is the second in the Biblical Interpretation and Proclamation track of the Candler DMin program and the first course unique to that track. Its focus is the theology of Scripture, understood not as an examination of the theologies found in Scripture but rather as the study of the effects different ways of thinking about Scripture have on Christian faith and practice. It will introduce students to debates within the church concerning both the authority of Scripture and its role in shaping Christian teaching, with the goal of helping participants to reflect systematically on the challenges of speaking both meaningfully and truly about God and God's work from a Christian point of view. Coursework is designed both to build on the tools of congregational and social analysis introduced in the first semester of the DMin program and to prepare students for more focused work in biblical exegesis and congregational teaching and preaching that follow in the program's second and third years.",
