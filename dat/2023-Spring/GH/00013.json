    "course_description": "Students will develop skills in abortion and maternal mortality measurement using WHO and CDC criteria in populations with safe or unsafe abortions. Students will also use case studies to evaluate the influence of political and legal decisions, ethics, human rights conventions, social justice and religious approaches on abortion practice, contraception, post-abortion care, and abortion-related mortality. They will use Values Clarification and Attitudes Transformation (VCAT) techniques to clarify and inform their own values on abortion. They will learn to describe the impact of terminology and values on national and international abortion debates, describe/learn about clinical abortion services and treatment for unsafe abortion, develop grant proposals to support program activities that prevent abortion mortality, and develop well-articulated arguments to advocate for the global elimination of maternal mortality from abortion.",
