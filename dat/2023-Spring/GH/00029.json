    "course_description": "This course introduces students to global and local issues in chronic non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and control. NCDs are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. In addition to their considerable health impact, NCDs pose a critical threat to development. Their complex etiology requires interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral approaches to prevention and control. The course highlights the burden and etiology of major NCDs, addresses approaches for surveillance of outcomes and risk factors, and lays out a comprehensive framework for prevention and control. The framework covers primary, secondary and tertiary prevention; population-level and individual-level approaches to delivering interventions; and major principles and strategies necessary for effective prevention including evidence-based interventions, life-course perspective, health systems strengthening, whole-of government and multi-sectoral action, among others.",
