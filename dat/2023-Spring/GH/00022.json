Working in small groups of peers, students iteratively prepare sections of the proposal. Enrollees in the class will learn the following skills: identifying appropriate literature; formulating aims and objectives; selecting and describing appropriate methodologies; planning field work, timelines and simple budgets; clear and concise writing; and peer review. Individual class projects can be used as the basis for seeking funding for summer applied practice experience.",
