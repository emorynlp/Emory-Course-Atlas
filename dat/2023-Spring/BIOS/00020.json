    "course_description": "Examines the fundamental role of the likelihood function in statistical inference, ancillary and sufficient statistics, estimating functions, and asymptotic theory. This course presents conditional, profile and other approximate likelihoods; various ancillary concepts; generalizations of Fisher information in the presence of nuisance parameters; optimality results for estimating functions; and consistency/asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood and estimation function-based estimators. It briefly discusses alternative approaches to inference including Bayesian, Likelihood Principle, and decision theory. Prerequisite: BIOS 710.",
