You will consider your options for post-graduation study and work using your rhetorical skills. You will learn of the great variety of uses and theories of rhetoric by important people both in the past and in more recent times. Most important, you will join a conversation that has been going on for a couple of thousand years. My hope is that you will enjoy our pilgrimage into the history and theory of a vibrant and time-tested field while we share the stories, dreams, and hopes of many people.",
