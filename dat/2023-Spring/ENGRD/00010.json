By considering the special case of Atlanta, and writing as an invention emerging from the practice of many disciplines, we will consider how the past, present, future, and planning of a city is represented.  In additional to reading great writing and practicing our own writing, production, and fieldwork, we will consider the challenges of managing a publication by contributing to the nuts and bolts work of producing the Atlanta Studies Journal.",
