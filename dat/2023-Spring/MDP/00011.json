What if sustainability simply involved a return to honoring the process of regeneration inherent in every living thing, from subatomic particles to planetary systems? Exploring tenets of regenerative design, emergent strategy, Indigenous lifeways, and a sprinkling of mind-blowing quantum physics, this course shifts the paradigm of development to a philosophy of place, being, and solidarity outside of time. See - blowing your mind already!",
