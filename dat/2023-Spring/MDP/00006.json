What if sustainability simply involved a return to honoring the process of regeneration inherent in every living thing, from subatomic particles to planetary systems? Exploring tenets of regenerative design, emergent strategy, Indigenous lifeways, and a sprinkling of mind-blowing quantum physics, this course shifts the paradigm of development to a philosophy of place, being, and solidarity outside of time. See - blowing your mind already!",
    "course_description": "Applied Development is a module-based course through which experts from leading global development agencies (CARE, Habitat, World Bank, etc.) present students with a practical approach to various components of global development. Topics of discussion may include microfinance, resettlement, housing, market inclusion, education, or health topics. Experts allow students increased access to development agencies, while offering a practical approach to lectures and in-class exercises. Many of these modules and activities will be tied to case-studies and hands-on learning activities.",
