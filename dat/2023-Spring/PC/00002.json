    "course_description": "This course enables participants to examine pastoral care practices in different cultural and regional contexts. Key questions consider what can be learned for pastoral care and ministry in particular contexts through the exploration of practices in different places. By means of detailed explorations of case studies, students engage in social, socioeconomic, cultural, and pastoral analysis of contextual issues in pastoral care practice and ministry. The course builds students' skills in empathy, interpathy, social and cultural analysis, and theological reflection with a view to strengthening the practice of intercultural pastoral care.
