How do different societies decide what is monstrous and who is excluded or feared as a result?\n \nThis course will look at depictions of monsters in literature, film, and cultural theory--from Dracula and King Kong to cyborgs and zombies. Through an intersectional feminist lens, we'll explore the ways in which these texts depict ideas and fears about gendered and racialized others and we'll examine ways in which those who have been branded as monstrous have seized control of their own narratives, often through re-telling monster stories from a different perspective.",
