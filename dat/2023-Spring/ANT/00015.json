We will study language classification and historical relationships, typology and universals, sound and structural features, and writing systems, covering the major geographic regions of the world. Students will find out about such non-English phenomena as vowel harmony, click consonants, noun incorporation, and ergative-absolutive case. There will also be readings and discussions on related issues, including the theory of universal grammar, the relationship between language and culture, and the notion of creole exceptionalism.\nAll required readings will be made available online.",
