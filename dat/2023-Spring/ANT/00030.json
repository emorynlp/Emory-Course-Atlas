    "class_notes": "History of Anthropological Thought I\n\n\nThis seminar is an experiment in learning about \"the canon\" while also attempting to unsettle \"the canon.\" Students are introduced to the history of theoretical developments in socio-cultural anthropology since its beginnings in the 19th century up to the present, using a critical lens on intellectual/academic history. The course has four goals: (1) learn about some of the major anthropological theories, methods, schools of thought, and intellectual leaders as they gained currency during this period; (2) understand how race, gender, imperialism, and power informed the development of the field's dominant canon; (3) learn about and explore ways to re-center and recover lost legacies, intellectual pioneers, and \"otherwise\" routes of doing anthropology; and (4) begin to establish one's own intellectual relationship to these histories and routes of anthropological thought and praxis. Approaches include: American anthropology, British social anthropology, French structuralism, interpretive anthropology, practice theory, feminist anthropology, critical race theory, and Indigenous knowledge praxis. Readings include works by Pierre Bourdieu, Franz Boas, Ella Deloria, Katherine Dunham, Faye Harrison, Zora Neale Hurston, Claude Levi-Strauss, Bronislaw Malinowski, Margaret Mead, Lewis Henry Morgan, Bernard Perley, E.E. Evans-Pritchard, and Victor Turner. Requirements include: active participation in seminars, discussion leadership, three short papers, and one final paper.",
