Since archaeology is a subdiscipline of anthropology, this course will contextualize archaeological research and interpretation in terms of its significance to the broader discipline of anthropology. The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the major contributions that archaeology has had to World Prehistory. In this course, students are introduced to the most famous archaeological sites in the world with themes centered around the following: evidence of early humans, first cities, death and burial, art and architecture, ritual and religion, warfare, sacrifice and conflict, great inventions. Specific attention will be paid to the history of archaeological research and how it shapes our interpretations and conceptions of the past. This course will also address archaeology's role within the broader field of anthropology and how archaeological research furthers the goals of anthropology.",
