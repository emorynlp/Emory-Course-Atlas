We are concerned with the disfranchised in the broadest sense of the term, groups who were considered incapable of representing themselves or writing their own histories indeed, often as people without history, and certainly without an archive. We will investigate different modes of disenfranchisement, and different kinds of silences.\nThe seminar will examine how recent intellectual and political challenges and debates have produced new ideas of history and archive. We will examine new trends in the writing of history following interventions by feminism, the African American and Dalit movements, anti-colonial, postcolonial and `minority histories'. While the instructors' specialization means the seminar is built around the history and historiography of North America and South Asia, students working on other parts of the world will be encouraged to bring their own questions, perspectives and readings to the table to enrich the conversation and extend the scope of our discussions.)",
