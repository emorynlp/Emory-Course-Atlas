It will trace how feminist ideas have circulated through different methods, approaches, and perspectives, while fostering the development of students' analytical skills within a comparative feminist framework. The readings and discussions will challenge students to rethink complex meanings of difference and apply these understandings to pressing political and legal concerns within our modern world. Five core theoretical concepts (gender, difference, women's experiences, the personal is political, and intersectionality) will structure the semester, supplemented by feminist questions raised by film, art, social movements, and questions of social justice.",
