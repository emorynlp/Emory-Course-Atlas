We have two goals, the first of which will be to understand the queer subject in and of itself. Through the lens of psychoanalysis and a materialist framework, we will look at the playful ways in which sixteenth century authors problematized both sex and gender. Our second goal will be to explore queer desire and how it destabilizes heteronormativity through the totality of its oppositions. We will use both primary and secondary sources to examine the concepts of queer subjectivity, the rigidity (or lack thereof) of the gender binary in Renaissance thought, and the performativity of gender and sexuality through various works. In the end, we will question and examine our current understanding of the etiology of queer identity.)",
