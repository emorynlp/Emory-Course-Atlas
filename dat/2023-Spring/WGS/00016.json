This semester, we will focus on the period from the early republic to post-Reconstruction to examine how myths about women developed and how they were perpetuated and by whom. Topics include political and economic activities of different groups of women; how ideas about race and class influenced expectations regarding women's work; women's lives across divisions of public vs. private; laws and customs that prescribed or criminalized women's activities and behavior; practices in medicine and healing; and family, marriage, and sexuality. We will also investigate connections between these and larger political, social, cultural, and economic developments and institutions that shaped the trajectory of U.S. history. Class discussions and papers will focus on the circumstances in which women of different groups appear in primary sources, myths formed and perpetuated in some of these sources, and evidence that challenges these myths. We will also discuss what women's history is, how it has been written, and ongoing debates around it.",
