The course will locate key texts in the historical and political contexts in which they were written, and seek to connect them to the key questions of the moment with which they struggled. Students will trace the ways in which questions about power, race, gender, and sexuality are taken up within interdisciplinary conversations. The course will explore how theory scaffolds our epistemological stakes in research, writing and practice, and seek to deepen our sense of what constitutes a feminist research subject, or a feminist method.",
