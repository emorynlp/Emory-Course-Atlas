This course will explore central aspects of the American legal system from a queer and feminist perspective, and ask how we might approach questions of gender, race, sexuality and ability in relation to justice. We will look both at critical scholarship and at legal cases as we follow the key debates in queer and feminist legal theory. We will also develop a set of methodological tools to help us better understand the operation of our systems of governance, the role of law and policy in maintaining and/or challenging social hierarchies. The course will explore the idea that legal systems help create, not just regulate sexual subjects. Looking to historical feminist legal theory, we will examine what's the most strategic way forward in our contemporary legal landscape.",
