Themes of reproductive justice, as well as disparate access to reproductive health as structured by race, location, age, nationality, sexuality, and gender identity will be central, as will be the spate of recent legal cases involving abortion, fetal personhood, embryo preservation, gender equality, and the separation of church and state. Finally, a comparative and transnational lens will introduce students to struggles and regimes of reproductive rights and justice elsewhere in the world.)",
