The aim of this seminar course is to examine and recover the history of women in India. Scholars have engaged for a while now in reconstructing lives and careers of distinguished women - leaders, artists, activists. We will read a variety of books on pre-modern and modern India to examine the history, lives and careers of India's women and examine how successful historical investigations have been, what their limitations are, and how we might open up new set of questions and approaches.)",
