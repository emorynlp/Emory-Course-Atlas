We will undertake three tasks this semester: \n(1) reading and discussing important pedagogical theories in order to provide conceptual frameworks for your teaching. You will write a short theoretical reflection on teaching;\n(2) producing a statement of teaching philosophy;\n(3) producing a syllabus and supporting materials (assignments, exams, projects etc.) for WGS200.\nAlong the way we will engage current debates in pedagogical research and commentary (via the Chronicle of Higher Education), we will create a toolkit of materials, activities and techniques for teaching, and we may occasionally invite a guest speaker to the class. Attention will be paid through the semester to the challenges and difficulties that arise in the classroom and we will discuss strategies for meeting those challenges. Flexibility is built into the syllabus we can adapt the syllabus to accommodate your interests, needs and goals as they emerge.",
