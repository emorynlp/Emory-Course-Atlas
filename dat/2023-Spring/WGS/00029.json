What are the life experiences, political priorities, and social relations of gender-variant and same-sex loving people in the Global South? Guided by Anjali Arondekar and Geeta Patel's observation that geopolitics provides the exemplars, but rarely the epistemologies for queer theory, this course works toward generating epistemologies of gender and sexuality from the Global South. We will read and debate critiques of the US and Eurocentrism of queer theory and methodological proposals for how to do queer scholarship in the Global South. We will also survey of exemplary scholarship on sexuality and gender variance in the Global South to see what theoretical insights we can glean. Our readings will span history, anthropology, area studies, and sociology. One of our key questions will be whether queer theory focused on the Global South demands a different set of methods that those of North American and European focused queer theory.",
