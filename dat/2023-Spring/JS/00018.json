In studying the historical constructions of gender and sexualities in modern Jewish culture from the Enlightenment to contemporary times, we will critically reassess the trope of the Jewish family as the bulwark of tradition against the encroachments of modernity. We will pair our readings in history and literature with films, a fieldtrip, and discussions of current events. Topics of study include: the Jewish Enlightenment and critiques of arranged marriages; Jewish nationalism and the feminized Jewish man; sexual politics of Hebrew and Yiddish; dybbuks, cross-dressing, and transgendered dreams in Yiddish fiction; constructing Hasidic femininity; and reproductive agency among Haredi women. Animated by the key questions and themes of the course, students will write a final research paper on a related topic of their choosing.",
