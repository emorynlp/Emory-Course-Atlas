It will consider a range of viewpoints including aesthetic, existential, phenomenological, psychoanalytic, and politics. Engaging with artworks that take cue from the philosophies of Fanon will be our primary way of pursuing analysis of his texts. Likewise, the course will screen films that engage with some of the thematics that run throughout his oeuvre such as (but not limited to): questions of language and representation, anti-blackness and sexism, poetics, alienation, and the psychic life of power and colonial violence.)",
