Confucian ideas of women and gender faced an unprecedented challenge from feminism at the beginning of the twentieth century. This course examines the history of the encounter between Confucianism and feminism. Students will explore Confucian views on women, (Western and East Asian) feminist critiques, and more recent revisionist scholarship. The material covered in the course includes written works from a wide variety of disciplines: philosophy, history, literature, etc. and also visual resources. Toward the end, the possibilities of Confucian feminism and feminist Confucianism for the modern world will be explored.",
