On two extremes, we can use our past experiences to inform our thoughts and decisions, or we can use what is supported by science. Most of us use a combination of both, but what happens when our lived experience conflicts with science and vice versa? Are we aware of how our biology shapes our lived experience or how our lived experience impacts science and its use in society? We will explore these topics through the lens of biological sex and gender, race and human genetics, and other topics.",
