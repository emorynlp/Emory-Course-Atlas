Topics range\nfrom aggression and dominance  to affiliation, sex and peaceful coexistence. The evolution of the large brain and remarkable intelligence of primates has been explained as related to the complexity of their societies: survival in such societies requires\nsophisticated social skills and a thorough understanding of the relationship\nnetwork. Course segments focus on the motivational and cognitive processes\nunderlying coalition formation, reciprocal exchange of benefits, reconciliation\nfollowing conflict, and the origin of moral systems. Parallels with human\nbehavior will be discussed.",
