We will cover major pre-historical extinctions and modern extinctions caused in many ways by humans.  Non-science majors are welcome.  Students will be assigned two books:  Extinction:  How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago, by Douglas Erwin, 2015, ISBN-13: 978-0691165653 and The Sixth Extinction:  An Unnatural History, by Elizabeth Kolbert, 2015, ISBN-13: 978-1250062185.
