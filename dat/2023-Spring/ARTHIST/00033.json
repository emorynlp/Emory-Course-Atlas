    "class_notes": "Art History has undergone dramatic changes over the last decade. This course considers the state of the field of 20th century art history over the last ten years or so. What are the current stakes of the field? How has it changed? What, if anything, remains unchanged? What are the kinds of questions that scholars are asking today? Largely comprised of guest lectures, each week will introduce a new speaker, providing a unique approach to the discipline, and new ideas about what matters in art history today. In advance of each week, we will read a scholar's recent work and discuss it with them (either in person or via Zoom). In the end, the aim is to offer a broad sweep of art historical thinking today and gain some insight into what matters and what should matter in art history today. For a list of the ten invited speakers and topics please contact Professor Cronan.",
