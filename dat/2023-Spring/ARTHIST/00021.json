Our investigations will include classic studies by Peter Brown, Emile MÃ¢le, and Benedicta Ward and along with more recent work on the subject, including Sherry Reames, Cynthia Hahn, and Julia M. H. Smith. Besides the inherent interest of how a site or cult chose to present itself in poignant and relatable narratives and imagery of the saints, two issues of approach will be emphasized. Since saints' narratives have long been a topic of interest for historians and scholars of theology, a first question is, what is the contribution of the relatively newer work in art history to the study of hagiography? Related to this, in view of the interest of current work on materiality and on topographies of sacred space, are there certain kinds of objects, materials locations, or strategies that are particularly effective in relaying saintly biography or involving the beholder?\nArt History major/minor: Division II",
