Exploring the seven hills and their environs, themes will include: shaping the landscape--design and emulation; the ideology of the villa and landscape in poetry and prose; the iconographical programs of imperial and humanist gardens; hydraulics and automata in garden grottoes; fountains and sculpture programs; botany and the culture of curiosity; the changing relationship of the garden with the natural world. Throughout, we will consider the dialogue between the ancient and early modern worlds. The seminar will work closely with rare books, etchings, and maps held in the Rose Manuscript, Archive, and Rare Book Library and the Michael C. Carlos Museum.\nArt History major/minor: Division I or II\nArchitectural Studies minor: elective",
