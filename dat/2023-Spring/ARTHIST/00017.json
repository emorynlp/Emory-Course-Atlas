This innovative seminar, co-taught by an art historian and a practicing artist, will alternate between hands-on experimentation with materials (both traditional and unconventional) and theoretical-historical consideration of significant art historical uses of such materials in the 20th century. We will grapple with the economic, political, and cultural contexts that give meaning to artists' choice of materials and means of production. At the same time, we will ponder how materials might be thought to have agency in the artistic process.\nArt History major/minor: Division III\nArt History Visual Art Concentration: elective",
