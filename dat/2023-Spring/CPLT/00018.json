The course weaves analyses of narrative and performative elements, units, structure, forms, and formats of meaning and reference in religious texts with readings in comparative theology, intercultural and transnational studies, textuality, and narrative and performance theories. Readings, class discussion, and exercises in comparative readings are designed for students to become more cognizant of the units, structures, and superstructures that support the design, creation, publication, dissemination, and canonization of religious texts, as well as their relationality with texts from various religious traditions.\n\n\nClass discussions and comparative reading exercises will be informed by readings by Francis Clooney, Walter Benjamin, Georges Battaille, Jean-Luc Nancy, José Muñoz, Paulo Freire, Jacques Derrida, Gile Deleuze & Félix Guattari, Franz Fanon, Édouard Glissant, Mayra Rivera Rivera, and Calvin Warren, among others.\n\n\nAttendance and participation: 30%. Blogposts: 20%. Discussion lead/class presentations: 10%. Final research project: 40%",
