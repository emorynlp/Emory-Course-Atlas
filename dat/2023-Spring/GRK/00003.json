    "class_notes": "The first extended fictional prose narratives seem to appear in the Hellenistic age and display remarkable similarities of plot (young lovers separated by fate, struggling to be reunited). We will read at least one representative example, Longus's Daphnis and Chloe, and discuss its relation to the Greek dramatic tradition (especially comedy) and to the changed historical circumstances of its production and reception in the late Hellenistic and early imperial ages. If time permits, we will explore other novelistic texts as well.\nTexts: E.
