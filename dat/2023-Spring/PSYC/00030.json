For permission, please e-mail Dr. Gouzoules at psyhg@emory.edu) (From the dance of the honey bee, the \"honest advertising\" of frogs, and the question of why birds sing, to the symbolic abilities of primates and dolphins, recent studies of animal communication have provided considerable insight into the evolutionary origins of human language. What do animals communicate about? How do signals and displays originate? Do animals deceive one another? How do social and physical environments influence communication? Does communication provide a window on the cognitive abilities of animals? These and other questions will be explored in this seminar.)",
