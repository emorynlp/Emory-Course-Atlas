In this course, we will discuss how the platforms and apparatuses underlying media create the conditions for authorship. How do cameras, projectors, game consoles, televisions, and distribution channels inflect the media forms that they make possible? How do media technologies facilitate and constrain the creative endeavors of media makers? Starting from an initial basis in cinema and film theory, we will go on to explore this relationship in media such as video games, television, and video.",
