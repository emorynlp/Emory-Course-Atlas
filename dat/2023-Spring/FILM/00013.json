Weekly screenings representing a diverse range of queer aesthetic practices will be paired with readings and discussions about representations of LGBTQ+ people and the intersections with identity, race, and gender. Students will create their own queer(ed) texts in the form of moving image projects grappling with visions of LGBTQ+ people. \nMCP Elective",
