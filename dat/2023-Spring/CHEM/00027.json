Methods to be studied include nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 2D), infrared spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. A major part of the course will be focused on problem-solving techniques, including the integrated application of spectroscopic and spectrometry techniques to determine structures of polyfunctionalized organic compounds.",
