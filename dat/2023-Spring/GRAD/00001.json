    "class_notes": "Perhaps the most significant watershed moment in modern biomedical ethics occurred nearly 75 years ago in Nuremberg, Germany. In 1946-1947, an American tribunal accused dozens of Nazi doctors and medical researchers of war crimes and crimes against humanity for performing not just illegal medicine but unethical medicine in wartime camps, communities, and clinics. From the ashes of such immoral medicine emerged what is now known as the Nuremberg Code, which became the basis for all subsequent biomedical research ethics and, in many ways, modern medicine.  How did such bad medicine come about?  How was it justified?  What was at stake?  This course considers the complex relations between Nazi and American biomedical science from the mid-19th Century through to the Nuremberg Medical Trial.  It culminates in an experiential exploration of potentially dangerous, ethically dubious yet medically urgent research.  \n \nApply for the course here:\nhttps://forms.gle/oHex2JTuFybyTnrn6",
