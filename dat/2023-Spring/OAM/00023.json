    "class_notes": "Organizations are engaged in a war for talent as human resources increasingly become a source of competitive advantage in many industries. Talent management has traditionally revolved around standard operating procedures to hire, train and retain employees rather than deep analysis. People analytics involves the use of data and analytic tools to inform decisions about how to manage people. Leading organizations are increasingly using sophisticated methods to analyze employee, business, industry and labor market data instead of relying on 'gut feel' or practices that `worked in the past.'\nThis course aims to train students to produce fact-based insights into the demography of organizations and answers to critical talent questions such as:\n* Whom to hire?\n* How engaged are our employees?\n* How do we evaluate performance?\n* Whom to promote?\n* Who is at risk of leaving? What are we doing to keep them?\n* What training and development should we provide?\n* How do we evaluate the effectiveness of incentives, training programs and other interventions?\nLearning Objectives of the Course:\nBy the end of this course, you should understand:\n* The range of areas where analytics are being used to improve how people are managed\n* Conceptual underpinnings of major people decisions\n* Basics of where to find appropriate data and how to set up analyses\n* Outlines of more sophisticated approaches to analyzing data\n* Major pitfalls and best practices in people analytics",
