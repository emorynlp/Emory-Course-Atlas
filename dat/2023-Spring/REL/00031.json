Attention will be given to the integration of your religious study with future careers. Written work will include academic writing but also a variety of other styles and voices, possibly including advocacy, briefing, policy statement, podcasting, or creative expression. The general theme of the course is Religion and the World is Crisis, which may include climate, nationalism, capitalism, and racism.",
