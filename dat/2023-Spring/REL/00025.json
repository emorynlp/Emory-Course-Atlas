What sorts of lives are good lives?  How might goodness relate to our flourishing?  \n- Our approach will be broadly philosophical. We will read and discuss together a range of texts as we pursue our questions about goodness, ethics, and forms of life.  Some texts will be philosophical and theological, some biographical, some literary, some filmic.   \n- This is a discussion class: we are in this together, and we learn from one another as well as from our readings.  Bring yourselves to the table.  Your attendance and participation are essential to the success of this course and are a required part of the class.  \nWe build these conversations together, as an activity in community.
