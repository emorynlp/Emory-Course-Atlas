Introduction to African and African American Diaspora Religions)\n(This course examines African religions such as Nigerian Ifá-Òrìsà tradition, Congolese religions, indigenized Christianity and Islam as well as African Diaspora religions of Haitian Vodou, Cuban Lucumí and Palo, Jamaican Rastafari, and Black American Hoodoo and Conjure traditions. Employing a comparative religion approach, we explore Black Atlantic religious themes such as: God(s), spirit, and ancestor veneration, divination and sacred space, initiation and sacred arts, healing and the environment, gender and power, the impact of slavery on conversion/continuity, migration and diaspora. Ultimately, this introductory course encourages students to reevaluate their understanding of Africana religions as they gain familiarity with diverse cultural philosophies and ritual knowledge systems of these valuable ancestral traditions.)",
