This seminar course will explore who Harvey Milk was during his life (a \"New York Jew,\" a gay man, a community activist, and a politician) and who he became after his death (a martyr and iconic figure). Resources for our exploration of Milk's life, legacy, and legend will include biographical articles and books, a documentary film, the feature film \"Milk\" (starring Sean Penn), a stage play and a television film based upon it, an opera, an oratorio, and a variety of artistic images and cultural objects. Through our focus on Milk's life and cultural \"afterlives,\" we will investigate the intersectional nature of identity, the construction and interpretation of \"hero\" and martyr figures, the nature of collective memory, the ways in which religious language and imagery are used to honor \"secular saints,\" and how conflicting claims are often made for cultural icons.)",
