Cast the Yijing (I-Ching). Look to the stars. Read your palms. In search of secret knowledge, we interpret dreams, clouds, earthquakes, eclipses, needles, dung, dead bodies, birds, the tea leaves in the bottom of our cups, the number of petals on a flower.\n We want to see the future, we want to know what choices to make, we want to understand hidden realities, we want to see what is hidden in our own minds. Is today my lucky day? Who should I love? When should we get married? Where should I dig a grave? Which med school to apply to? We want to know our fate. But what is fate? What is luck? What exactly is \"unscientific\" about divination?\n We will be looking at divination practices from various countries and times, with a focus on the the Tarot, Yijing, horoscopes, spiritualism, and the body as an object of divination, as well as the overlaps with gambling, therapy, and prophecy. Students taking this class will be expected to actually practice some (not all) of these divination techniques, and to create their own divination system. Students are not required to either believe or disbelieve.)",
