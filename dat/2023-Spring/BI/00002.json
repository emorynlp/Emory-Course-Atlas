    "course_description": "Empire building, & strategies of subjugating others for gold, god, & glory, has characterized international relations throughout history. From the Hebrew Bible to the New Testament, most biblical books were written within the colonial context of one imperial power or another. In modern colonial history, the Bible was an important part of selling \"god\" to the colonized while their lands were being taken. This course will study the Bible from the perspective of postcolonial theories to examine its entanglement with the empires & in search of ways of reading for decolonization & liberation.",
