    "course_description": "Continuing from Applied Epidemiology I, further insight into confounding is explored as well as effect modification. Methods of hypothesis formulation and analysis of 2x2 tables (point estimation and confidence levels) are described in detail as well as sample size calculations. Different approaches to control for extraneous variables in the design of studies are presented, such as randomization, matching, and restriction. The use of stratification for assessing effect modification and confounding is provided followed by an introduction to mathematical modeling. Different issues in the use of matching in case- control studies are presented. Statistical packages such as SAS and OpenEpi are used.",
