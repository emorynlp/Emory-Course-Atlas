To bridge the gap between knowledge and action, there is a need for more community based participatory research. Art-based methods are qualitative tools that uses artistic processes to express ones lived experiences in appropriate, ethical, and representative ways and allow for deeper research insight and interpretation. This course is designed to help students to understand how arts-based methods are currently applied in community research practice within the broad field of public health. From Hip Hop, poetry & theater to digital stories, paintings & photography, we will examine how arts-based methods are applied in public health issues including social justice, gender equity, mental health & food security.",
