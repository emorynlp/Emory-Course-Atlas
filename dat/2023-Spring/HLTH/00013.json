Students should be prepared to discuss health conditions caused by combat, sexual violence, and other forms of traumatic injury.  All semester, we will reflect on how different forms of evidence (novels, poetry, testimonials, theoretical essays, and clinical case-studies) can reveal different facets of traumatic experience.  We will also discuss the expanding sense of trauma in contemporary culture through popular notions of triggeredness, microaggressions, safe spaces, etc.",
