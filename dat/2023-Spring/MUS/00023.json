We will build a critique of cultural production emphasizing an intersectional framework and critique of oppression via black studies, black feminisms, and queer theory. This class will bring together various media, social science, film, and art as we discuss legacies of blues, funk, hip hop, and techno. We will work toward a broad definition of black music to consider its history and global implications.)",
