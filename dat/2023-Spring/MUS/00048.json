Focus areas include some of the major religions in the world, such as Islam, Christianity and Hinduism, as well as less widely practiced religions and spiritual practices, such as Japanese Shinto, Zen Buddhism, and Javanese Kejawen. The interdisciplinary design of this course offers students opportunities to practice and examine the art forms through the lens of performance studies, ethnomusicology, anthropology and religious studies.",
