    "class_notes": "This writing seminar, co-taught with the Philosophy department, explores why and how we respond to music emotionally. Some of the topics covered are the role of film music in evoking our emotional response, different categories of musical emotions, how we develop certain narratives about music, sound art, and ecomusicology. Philosophically, the seminar focuses on the emotional resonances and musical nuances of ethical, social, and political forces in human and nonhuman ecosystems. We work through contemporary phenomenologies and social theories of affect, vital energy, resonance, vibrations, atmospheric mood, and what Audre Lorde called eros.",
