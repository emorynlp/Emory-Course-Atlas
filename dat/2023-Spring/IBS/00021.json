The goal of this course is to strengthen the students' understanding of the interaction between environmental chemicals and specific organ systems of the human body, focusing on appreciation of cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the toxicity. This knowledge will be supplemented through outside readings and class discussions using a modified problem based learning (PBL) format. These interactions will serve to support the students' understanding of the material and provide them with a real world perspective of molecular toxicology.  Cross listed with EHS 740.",
