See course description for details.\n\"This seminar begins by exploring the social and legal meanings of intimacy and its relationship to other legal/political concepts, such as autonomy, privacy, and state intervention. We also will examine evolutions in the laws of intimacy regulating sexual, procreative, and family relationships, as well as the almost invisible ways that law shapes and influences other entangled and intense social relationships that could be labeled intimate, such as those between employer/employee; landlord/tenant; or doctor/patient. We will also consider if and how the law should respond to emerging patterns of digital intimacy. Using interdisciplinary and law and society methodology, this seminar aims to challenge current preconceptions about intimacy, legal regulation, and state.\"",
