    "class_notes": "This course surveys the substantive law governing the representation of clients facing deportation and civil immigration detention, commonly called removal defense. It covers the legal basis for deportation (removal) and immigrant detention, and the common defenses and legal strategies employed in advocacy before the immigration courts, which currently have over 1.8 million removal proceedings (cases) pending before them. This course investigates how changes in presidential administrations affect the function and precedent of the courts and prosecutorial/enforcement objectives; students will study current and past executive memoranda, attorney general opinions, and discuss how legal strategies must continuously adapt as policies change. Additionally, the course covers the practical implications of practicing removal defense law while confronting the uncertainty caused by the perpetual use of Article III courts, through nationwide lawsuits and injunctions, to control immigration enforcement and case law.",
