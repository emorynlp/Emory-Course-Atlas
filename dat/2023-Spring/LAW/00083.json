    "course_description": "This course deals with the allocation of judicial business between the state and federal courts, as well as the jurisdictional tensions that arise from a dual judicial system. In addition, the course considers the relationship between the federal judiciary and Congress, particularly as it implicates the legislature's power to structure and limit the federal courts' subject matter jurisdiction. This is a very practical course, as well as one that implicates important theoretical issues about decision-making institutions under our federal system of government.",
