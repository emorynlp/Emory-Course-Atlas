    "course_description": "This course will introduce students to the concept of intellectual property through the four forms of intellectual property regimes in the United States: copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents. The course looks at each of these regimes through a comparative lens, looking at how the purpose and protections are similar and different. This course is designed both for those who are interested in pursuing IP as a career, and those who are looking only for a basic knowledge of the subject. There are no prerequisites, and a scientific background is not required. At the end of the course, students should know the basics for each doctrine, the differences in the subject matter protected, how protection in each regime is established, the scope of the rights afforded, and remedies. Students should also be able to compare and contrast the law, policy, and theories for each type of intellectual.",
