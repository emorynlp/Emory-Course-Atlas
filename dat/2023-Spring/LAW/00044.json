    "course_description": "Since the end of the World War II and the start of the Nuremberg Tribunals, international criminal law (ICL) promised to be a tool for peace and justice, capturing many of our imaginations. While gaining some traction in the last 20 or so years, ICL has yet to live up to that promise. This course explores the goals and foundation of ICL before exploring how ICL is enforced and the substance of the crimes. Along the way, it examines the theoretical and practical barriers that suggests that ICL may always remain more of an ideal than a reality. The course will punctuate these lessons with examples of both the successes and failures of the enforcement from Cambodia to Rwanda to Sierra Leone and beyond.",
