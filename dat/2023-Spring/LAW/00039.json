    "course_description": "This course offers a survey of family law, including case law, statutory law, and the constitutional limitations on regulation of the family. A primary aim of the course is to introduce students to family law as a dynamic field of law concerning a basic social institution: the family. All students will (1) understand the key principles governing state recognition and regulation of the family; (2) demonstrate the ability to analyze and synthesize family law concepts and apply them to a variety of factual situations; (3) distinguish the legal roles and responsibilities of parents, children, and the state; and (4) think critically about the legal protections afforded to families. In addition, JD and LLM students will integrate family law principles with legal frameworks from other fields of law, such as contracts, constitutional law, and criminal law.",
