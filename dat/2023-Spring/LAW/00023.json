Yet less than 2% of civil cases are resolved by trial. This experiential course will explore the use of appropriate dispute resolution processes ¿ negotiation, mediation and arbitration, and various hybrids ¿ by which most legal conflicts are resolved.\nThe course, taught in an intensive format over three weekends, will provide practical skills and experience through a combination of lecture-discussion, exercises, and simulations to ground students in both ADR theory and practice.\"",
