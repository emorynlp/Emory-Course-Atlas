The project will integrate the students learning through the WTM Certificate and will address academic issues related to women, theology, and ministry. The Integrative Project will normally be taken as an additional one-credit-hour requirement in conjunction with a three-hour course in which the student is already enrolled and is an approved elective for the WTM certificate. Students also may enroll in a one hour directed reading course with a faculty member with whom they have previously studied in an approved WTM course to continue research begun in a previous course. Approval of the WTM director and faculty member is required in both cases.",
