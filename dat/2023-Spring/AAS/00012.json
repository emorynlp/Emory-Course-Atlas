While historically sensationalized or decontextualized, the myths and symbols of African deities have more recently been used as enduring and powerful conveyors of beauty and resistance. In this course, we will examine the ways deities from different African religious traditions are used in popular media by exploring their myths and mythic legacies. We will also pay attention to how African deities serve as perennial figures in art, television, films, fiction, and music. Some of the materials we will analyze include visual albums by Beyonc√©, shows and films from the Marvel Comic Universe, and music videos from Ibeji. In addition to obtaining an understanding of African deities and their myths, we will consider some of the persistent misconceptions about the religions from which they emanate.)",
