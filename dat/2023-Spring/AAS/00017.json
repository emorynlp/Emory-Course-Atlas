    "class_notes": "This course examines the theory of Black capitalism within a wide range of American contexts, varied by place and time. First, students are exposed to a tradition of radical scholarship that analyzes the intersections or articulations between racism and capitalism. We will explore some seminal texts by WEB DuBois, Manning Marable, and Cedrick Robinson, among others. Then students will also gain an understanding of how local economic development works to support or obstruct Black capitalism. Particular attention will be paid to how growth versus redistribution strategies impact Black communities. It will end by considering the intersection of race and class in struggles for economic and social justice from Black celebrities to voters, to activists and politicians.",
