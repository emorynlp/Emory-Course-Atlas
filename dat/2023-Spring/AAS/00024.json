In this course we will examine the inextricable link between business practice and race, tracing how understandings of race have evolved over time through the lens of marketing tactics. We will study this change over time from the era of Jim Crow segregation in the early 20th century, to the thriving post-World War II economy, to more recent decades when discussions of identity politics have increased.",
