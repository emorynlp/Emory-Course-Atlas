Specifically, students will examine the following three roles in 102, devoting 4-5 weeks to each: The young adult as (1) a consumer; (2) a traveler/tourist; and (3) a citizen. Students will use a textbook and supplemental materials to acquire the language necessary to communicate meaningfully about each topic. Through this process of examining identity formation, students in this course, together with its prerequisite, German 101, will develop a solid foundation in speaking, writing, reading, and understanding German and life in German-speaking countries.",
