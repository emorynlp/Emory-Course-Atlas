Examples of appropriate applications are critical to this course and will be provided by the instructor, as well as relevant BSHE faculty. This course is intended to complement other required courses in theory, intervention development, epidemiology and advanced statistical analysis. This course meets one time per week, and students are expected to attend each class. Assigned readings serve to augment the classes. Therefore, students are expected to complete readings before the class for which they are scheduled. Classes consist of example-based didactic lecture and student-led problem solving and discussion.",
