    "course_description": "Ethnography is a social scientific approach to studying human behavior and the cultural patterns of communities, congregations, and institutions. Pastoral practitioners have adopted \"theological ethnography\" as a method for garnering more extensive knowledge about ministry in congregational settings and local communities. In this course, students will be introduced to ethnography as social research requiring participation in fieldwork. Learners will apply basic techniques of ethnography, form the development of a research question to analysis of collected data, to better understand the religious practices of Christian communities, the lived realities of social groups, and social change.",
