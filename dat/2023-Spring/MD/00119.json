This will involve significant time in the multidisciplinary clinic (MDC) learning how the combination of surgical oncology, radiation oncology and medical oncology contribute to treating head and neck cancer. Further, substantial time will be spent in the operating room, assisting with ablative surgical oncology and reconstructive surgery (free and regional tissue transfer). Students will be expected to actively partake in wound closure, including basic plastics procedures of adjacent tissue re-arrangement and skin grafting. Competence in these procedures is an expectation at the end of the month. Students will round with the head and neck team and learn the art of managing these complex patients in the ICU and floor. Throughout the month, students will have dedicated time to spend with radiation oncology, medical oncology, speech language pathology/nutrition, neuro-radiology and head and neck pathology to understand the true necessity of a multidisciplinary team in the management of head and neck cancer patients.)",
    "course_description": "Innovations in clinical care are increasingly impacted by the development and implementation of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). As future clinicians, medical students should be informed and prepared for technological changes that will affect how they provide care for their patients. The goals of this senior elective are to demystify AI and ML in healthcare, enabling students to have informed conversations about these technologies and participate in their clinical advancement.",
