Literature can be on the alert in all of those senses. Both the love poetry of the troubadours as well as surrealist \"mad love\" alerts us to the presence of \"something\" that is not an object, but something else much more terrifying. Elevated through sublimation or degraded into comical obscenity, it turns poetry and narrative into an infinite address. This \"something\" can also make its presence felt as an affliction at the core of the social space. This alarm resonates, in various ways and different contexts (World Wars I and II), in Apollinaire's poetry, Bataille's Blue of Noon and Gracq's The Opposing Shore. As it attends to these afflictions, literature can become a strange wake-up call that breaks through everyday slumber to transmit what Gracq called \"something like a far-away alarm.\"  \nThe course will be taught in English. Texts will be read in their English translations.\n \nTexts may include:\nTroubadours:                  Guillaume IX, Jaufr√© Rudel, Arnaut Daniel [Selections]\nGuillaume de Lorris:      The Romance of the Rose\nApollinaire:                     Calligrammes: Poems of Peace and War\nTzara:                              Dada Manifesto\nBreton:                            Manifestoes of  Surrealism\nBataille:                          Blue of Noon\nGracq:                             The Opposing Shore",
