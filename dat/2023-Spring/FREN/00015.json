Through close and patient reading of several of his (often) funny and (always) idiosyncratic texts, we will learn about early modern politics, art, and society, and address questions related to themes such as: experience, pleasure, violence, sadness, death, gender and sexuality, humor, animality, friendship, writing, monsters, grottoes, illness, and (the failures of) education. Montaigne's Essais will be read in dialogue with thinkers and writers that bear witness to his diverse intellectual context and afterlife. We will also investigate related cases from the visual arts and explore the question of why there is such renewed interest in Montaigne today. Along with careful reading and active class discussion, students will undertake assignments both creative and analytic.",
