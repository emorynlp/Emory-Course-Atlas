We investigate where such attitudes come from, how they are disseminated throughout a society, and how they affect linguistic choices. We then look at real world applications and outcomes of language attitudes, focusing on issues of linguistic profiling and discrimination based on language use. Students will be introduced to both qualitative and quantitative methods for the elicitation and analysis of linguistic data, and will develop their own research projects.",
