The seminar is a sequel to Soc/Ling/QTM 446W and Soc 585 (Big/Small Data & Visualization). It aims to bring to a co-authored journal submission the work carried out by students in 446W/585 on different text corpora. Using a range of NLP tools, students will strive to provide a coherent picture of NLP analytics as these apply to their specific corpus. \nThae course is a 4-credit course fulfilling the writing requirement. \nCo-authorship. Co-authors for journal submissions include professor, undergraduate team members, and computer-science students who have helped develop the NLP tools. Graduate students are free to work alone on their corpus with no obligation of shared co-authorship. \nTeamwork and workload. Students will work in teams, one team per corpus. Teams will be expected to present their work, as a team, every two weeks throughout the semester and present four co-authored drafts of their ongoing work at regular intervals.\n\n\nFinal paper and literature review. Since the final paper is expected to be submitted to a journal, the literature review part of the paper will engage both appropriate NLP literature and specific topic literature as appropriate for the corpus (thus, a corpus of country folktales will need to address the literature on folktales). \nGrading. Final grade will be based on presentations, paper drafts, and final paper.",
