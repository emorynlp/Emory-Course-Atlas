After a brief overview of the history of Atlanta with specific focus on the increasing multiculturalism of the city, the course will introduce students to the theory and practice of linguistic landscape research with the goal of involving students in the observation, documentation, and analysis of different linguistic communities throughout metro Atlanta. Because the linguistic landscape to be examined is found out in the city, outings into the city both during and outside class time will be conducted. \nIn addition, course participants will showcase their own research into Atlanta's linguistic landscape on the website begun last year by Emory Linguistics students, Languages Across Metro Atlanta - https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/lama/.\nNo prior experience with linguistic landscape research required for participation in the course.\n\n\nAssessment criteria 1. Participation (25%) 2. Homework (25%) 3. Final project (40%) 4. Website development (10%)",
