    "class_notes": "(\"Semester Description: Individuals in every society are enmeshed in powerful political, social and economic systems that are resistant to change. Occasionally, however, people do band together and challenge these systems: they picket, they march, they strike, they sit-in, they form protest organizations and demand change. Such occasions, while infrequent, are important moments because they represent the rare opportunity for the normally powerless to challenge the normally powerful. This course offers an exploration of such moments. It examines the origins, dynamics, and consequences of social movements through both sociological theory and empirical case studies.",
