We will approach our inquiry\nthrough the intellectual framework of racial colonial capitalism.\nMy learning objectives for you in this course are four-fold. I want you to: 1) further develop a\ndisciplined practice of close reading; a practice that is crucial to the work of a social theorist, 2)\nenhance your level of theoretical sophistication (which comes from being well read in your field,\nand others), 3) put into practice the art of asking beautiful questions (don't you just abhor those\nlong non-question questions that folks ask at conferences? Me too! Asking profound, thought\nprovoking, expansive-yet-concise questions actually comes from intentioned practice), and to 4)\nwalk away with a more historically-based and nuanced understanding about race, racism and\nprocesses of racialization.",
