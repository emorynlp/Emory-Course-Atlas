This half-semester, seminar-style course will explore the possible impact of the criminal justice system on the epidemiology of infectious diseases and on health indicators in general. The correctional setting will be used as a case study to illustrate how environment, public policy, behavior and biology all interact to determine the well-being of a population. Lessons learned from studying correctional health are applicable to understanding the determinants of health for other institutionalized populations and in other controlled settings. We have plans to make a trip to a local correctional facility.",
