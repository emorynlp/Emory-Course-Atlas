It is vital to understand what forces shape visual culture and how it shapes our thinking about myriad topics such as politics, race, class, and gender. Students will explore visual culture in multiple mediums including art, architecture, photography, comics, digital media, advertising, and television. We will begin by studying the major theories behind visual culture. Then, we will focus our critical inquiry on theories of orientalism and imperialism. We will consider how issues of authority, power, and positionality shape the creation and interpretation of visual images.",
