    "class_notes": "Critical Race Theory (CRT) illuminates the core phenomenology of law in the U.S. and its relationship with race. Some of the questions, vocabulary and conceptual frameworks imminent in this scrutiny of race and law are also useful for examining the relationship of caste and the law in India. At the same time, there's an existing body of work on caste and the law in India that would pose its own set of critical questions to CRT. For example, despite an early emergence of caste in the juridical discourse in the U.S. (in 1923), has CRT attended to the correlation, if any, of race and caste? Can the understanding of caste and the law in India inform and broaden the existing contours of CRT in any way? \nCourse instructor: 2022-23 Fulbright-Nehru Visiting Chair on Civil and Human Rights at Emory University, Sumit Baudh is Professor and Executive Director, Centre on Public Law and Jurisprudence at the O.P. Jindal Global University (JGU) in India.",
