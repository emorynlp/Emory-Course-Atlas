This course is an opportunity for students to read Marx through an interdisciplinary lens in a comfortable and supportive setting. Readings will begin with essential texts by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and will range from labor history and cultural studies to Marxist feminism and the study of social space. We will try to understand why and how Marx has been taken up across academic disciplines far beyond economic theory. This discussion-based S/U class will be centered around weekly readings. Selected authors beyond Marx may include Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, Donna Haraway, Stuart Hall, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.",
