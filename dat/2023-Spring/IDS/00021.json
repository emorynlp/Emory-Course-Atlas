Meeting schedule to be determined based on availability of students who are enrolled. This course will involve attendance at a broad variety of lectures from a spectrum of disciplines and a series of class discussions and written reflections about the lectures and related topics. While not always directly related to one's own research questions, lectures from very different perspectives can often trigger connections and ideas about one's own topic. Thus, class discussions and activities will focus on critical thinking across disciplines in ways that expand interdisciplinary perspectives.",

Because the ILA does not offer graduate courses, we have developed this proseminar to meet this requirement for those students who are unable to register for a graduate course in their area of study.",
