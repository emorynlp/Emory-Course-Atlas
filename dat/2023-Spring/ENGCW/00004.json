Complete course atlas information (including texts and grading) and application form will be available on the Creative Writing Program website: https://creativewriting.emory.edu/index.html\n\n\nThis is an intermediate, intensive workshop in which you will read, discuss, create, revise, and otherwise experience an abundance of poetry. We will seek, in our meetings, to make connections between the language and ideas of poetry and those of the worlds we inhabit. Together we will develop and expand a shared vocabulary in which poems can be made, read, understood, furthered, and enjoyed. You will read five full-length poetry collections, as well as an abundance of other texts (posted to Canvas) including poems, essays, and other materials in order to familiarize yourself with the breadth of possibilities and traditions from which you might draw. The Creative Writing Program is hosting three readings this semester, and your presence will be required at all of them.",
