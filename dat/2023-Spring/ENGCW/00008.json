Complete course atlas information (including texts and grading) and application form will be available on the Creative Writing Program website: https://creativewriting.emory.edu/index.html\n\n\nStudents must provide some evidence they have done journalistic and/or nonfiction writing (they should attach a writing sample of 6-10 pages of prose or journalistic writing to their application) or explain in a short (3-page) essay what motivates them to seek a course that emphasizes that genre. This course is not open to first-year students.\n\n\nThis workshop is focused on long-form, nonfiction magazine and feature writing -- reading it, reporting it, writing it, and doing so in ways and by means that separate the exceptional from the pedestrian. This is nonfiction. Be prepared to be a reporter, to meet people face-to-face, to ask questions, to see and hear things with your own eyes and ears. We'll have visiting experts on hand as we discuss where great ideas come from, how to be strategic in your reporting, the art of the interview, and crafting stories, then stories within stories. We're looking mostly at print, but we will see beyond the dead tree media at the growing opportunities for magazine-style writing and long-form narratives online. Ultimately, the goal of the course is for you to become a considerably wiser and more effective nonfiction story-teller, for which the basis is sound reporting. Students should budget for photocopying.",
