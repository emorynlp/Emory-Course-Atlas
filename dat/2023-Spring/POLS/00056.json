We will examine models that study the role of elections as accountability-enhancing mechanisms and take a look at empirical evaluations of their predictions. We will also explore some of the challenges of electoral competition in developing democracies. The focus of this part of the course will be on electoral manipulation and on how such manipulation interferes with the accountability-enhancing role of elections.",
