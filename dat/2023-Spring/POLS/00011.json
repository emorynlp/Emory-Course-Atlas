    "class_notes": "Machiavelli was the infamous teacher of ruthless power politics, even tyranny. He was also the political philosopher who first conceived of a distinctly modern vision of republican government that went on inspire the rise of liberal democracies, including the United States. What does ruthless power politics have to do with modern republicanism? We will find out together through a close reading of Machiavelli's two most famous books: The Prince and The Discourses on Livy. Evaluation will be based chiefly on class participation and papers.",
