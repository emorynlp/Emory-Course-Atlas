The course covers how/why attitudes (e.g., trust, racial resentment, and conservatism) and behaviors of individuals and interest groups affect political choices by municipal, state, and federal policymakers regarding the police (e.g., racial diversity and police budgets) and policing (e.g., use of force). The course also explores how/why political choices by voters and municipal, state, and federal policymakers regarding the police and policing shape attitudes and behaviors of individuals and interests.\n\n\nGiven the subject matter, we will consider and discuss dimensions of racial inequality/equality and justice/injustice throughout the course. Although we will mainly focus on the United States, there will be comparative considerations and examples from abroad on the course's theme.\nFurthermore, the course will draw mainly from empirical social science studies, but include a mix of popular media and contemporary events (e.g., Ferguson) that illuminate the intersection of politics and policing.\nThere are no topical pre-requisites (e.g., urban politics, criminal justice, or public policy). But, the course is a research course. It assumes students can at least comprehend, discuss, and question basic elements of research design and empirical results, as well as construct and state good hypotheses, know basic means of data collection, and conduct elementary quantitative tests, if necessary (e.g., correlations and regression). If you can't, the first week of materials include a few simple readings and videos to get you going.)",
