It assumes no prior knowledge of the region, but students are expected to have some background in political science (for example, POLS 110 or 120). The course is structured chronologically, with emphasis on the transformative processes initiated by the fall of Soviet-style communism in 1989. Both domestic politics (institution-building, parties and ideologies, value change, economic transformation, democratization and authoritarian reversals) as well as trans-national issues (European integration, migration, foreign and security policies) will be discussed. The geographic focus will be mainly on East-Central Europe (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary) and the Balkans (Bulgaria, Romania, Albania and former Yugoslavia).",
