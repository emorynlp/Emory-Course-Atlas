It is about the politics in and of its cities. Such politics, referred to as local or municipal politics, involves contests among individuals and groups to acquire influence over the branches, institutions, priorities, and decisions of city governments, and sometimes county and other local governments. Studying urban politics involves seeing, observing, identifying, describing, and explaining institutional choices of city governments (e.g., city budgets and service allocations) and how political behavior (e.g., protest and voting) and representation of groups and interests at the local level influence and are affected by institutional choices of city governments. In short, urban politics is about \"who gets what, when, how,\" plus where and why, from city governments.",
