Will cover the foundations of probability theory, properties of random variables, asymptotic approximations, methods for developing and evaluating statistical estimators, and hypothesis testing. The second half of the course will develop the linear regression model with a focus on its assumptions, statistical properties, inference, and diagnostics. An additional goal of the course is to improve students' statistical computing skills through in-class exercises and problem sets.\nRegistration Restrictions\nPOLS 508 or equivalent transfer credit as prerequisite.",
