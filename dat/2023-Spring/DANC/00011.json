    "class_notes": "Connecting the Mind to the Moving Body will present an experiential overview of different somatic practices (i.e. Alexander, Ideokinesis, Bartenieff Fundamentals, and core support techniques). All of these somatic forms require attention to breathing, alignment, proprioception, core support, sequencing and flexibility. Students will explore the interconnectedness of body and mind while focusing on the ways that somatic practices inform and intertwine with one's intellectual life, cultural identity, and embodied life experiences. Body knowledge will expand from guest movement teachers, readings, discussions, and journaling.",
