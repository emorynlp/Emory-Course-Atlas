ITAL202 is designed to help students build communication skills in Italian. We emphasize all four language skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing as well as cross-cultural competency. By the end of the semester, students should be able to (a) interact successfully in Italian, (b) understand a majority of what they hear and read in Italian, and (c) express themselves clearly in spoken and written Italian.",
