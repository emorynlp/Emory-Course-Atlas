This freshman seminar will examine the crossing of cultural and social barriers between the north and the south of the country, as represented in classics of Italian cinema about internal migration, like Visconti's Rocco and his brothers, and in mafia movies and tv series, which often intertwine with the long history of Italian transoceanic migration. Finally, we will explore a wide range of narratives investigating the migratory patterns across the Mediterranean, of which Italy is a crossroad where a multitude of stories and voices resonate.  This course will be taught in English",
