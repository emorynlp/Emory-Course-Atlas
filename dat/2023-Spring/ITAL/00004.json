It was composed during the period of the Black Death (the bubonic plague pandemic), which reduced the population of Florence from over 100,000 to less than 40,000. It narrates the story of a group of ten young people, three men, and seven women, who retreated to a country villa to self-quarantine. While there they spend their time telling stories - ten each for ten days - that continue to delight contemporary readers and provide a powerful insight into the human condition. In this course, we will focus on the intersection of gender, sexuality, and power in Boccaccio's work. In particular, we will analyze and interpret the ways categories of gender, class, and religion determine rhetorical choices. We will also highlight how the dominance of eros is affirmed by the narrators to support often divergent views of sexuality, moral choice, language, and truth.",
