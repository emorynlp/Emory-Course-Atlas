In this course, students will explore 1) what those benefits are, i.e. climate mitigation, urban cooling, coastal protection, as well as physical and mental health, 2) the approaches and challenges to quantifying the value those benefits provide, either through economic markets or intrinsic value; 3) how those benefits and values are mapped spatially; 4) approaches to revealing patterns of distributional inequity for nature's benefits; and 5) how policy-makers are attempting to integrate knowledge of nature's benefits into decisions at local, regional and global scales.",
