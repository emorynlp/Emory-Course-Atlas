We will draw objects, figures, and environments from observation and imagination, learning to create the illusion of life, movement, and depth using ink and paper. We will study the visual language of sequential art, analyzing a variety of graphic novels and manga. Students will use this language to tell their own stories, both fiction and nonfiction, through comics and narrative drawings.   NARRATIVE DRAWING & COMICS",
    "course_description": "This course develops skills in representational drawing as foundation for all disciplines and as an art form in itself. The student will draw from various subject matters and explore a variety of media, techniques, and concepts. Students will demonstrate an understanding of the formal elements (line, shape, value, and texture) as they relate to the principles of visual organization (harmony, balance, rhythm, and repetition, movement, dominance, and proportion). The foci of the studio will be the exploration of the formal elements of art in relation to constructing strong compositions and the study of the aesthetic, physical, and psychological properties of value and texture.",
