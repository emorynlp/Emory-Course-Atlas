We will learn to measure proportions, to apply linear perspective, to mix colors, and to create dynamic, powerful compositions. We will also explore various ways of departing from realism, experimenting with pastiche and abstraction. Ultimately, this course will help students build the skills necessary to develop their own creative voices as a painter and visual artist.  ACRYLIC PAINTING I",
