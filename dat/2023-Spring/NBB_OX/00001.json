    "course_description": "Students will learn basic principles of neuronal function, as well as how evolution has produced specializations in neural circuits in various invertebrate and vertebrate animals that allow them to do unique things in the natural world. Such comparative approaches not only help students understand how studies of neural specializations across species underlie behavioral diversity in the world around us, but also how to extrapolate generalities about how nervous systems organize behavior by identifying common operating principles in those mechanisms.",
