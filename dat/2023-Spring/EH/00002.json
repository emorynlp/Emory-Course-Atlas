    "course_description": "In this course, students will be introduced to the concepts of exposure science. Students will learn how contaminants are transported from sources to receptors and how human receptors are affected by such contact. Varying exposure science approaches, across a range of environmental media, including air, water, soil, and internal biological matrices, will be considered. Methods of assessment including direct monitoring of environmental media, modeling, as well as biomarkers of exposure will be presented and discussed in detail. Students will examine the literature of exposure science through readings, in-class article discussions, and by conducting a collaborative exposure assessment.",
