Models, when done right, provide an invaluable lens with which to view the world and think about policy solutions as well as empirical assessment. There will be an emphasis on what makes for a \"good\" model and what factors go into constructing a good model, such as substantive motivation, key variables/correlations, as well as how one approaches policy implications and statistical estimation. Potential topics include COVID/fake news, Rebellions/protests, matching/fair division, consumer choice/voting, and career concerns/contests.",
