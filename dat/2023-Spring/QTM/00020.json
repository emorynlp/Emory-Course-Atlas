For example, we might find the line that best fits the data, then act as if that line were a useful description of reality. With the right blend of intuition and luck, this can work --- we can get by with a model that is wrong but not too wrong --- but it's often helpful to have a more nuanced perspective. This class is an introduction to the theory and practice of doing statistics without simplistic modeling assumptions. We will cover regression, model selection, and optimal aggregation of estimators using a variety of models including kernel machines and neural networks. Our focus will be on understanding why estimators do or don't work and developing intuition about what to estimate and what modeling assumptions to use. Drawing exercises, computer visualization, and computer simulations will be used to get a feel for things.",
