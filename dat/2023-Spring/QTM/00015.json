Games in the everyday sense, like tic-tac-toe, chess, and poker are examples of interactions that can be examined with Game Theory. However, the tools that we will learn in this course can be more broadly applied to many political and economic phenomena. Candidates competing for votes, arms races, public good provisions, and bargaining are some of the many applications that we will examine. Although this course has no formal prerequisites beyond high school algebra, we will be applying rigorous reasoning and logical or mathematical aptitude is a plus.)",
