In the 18th century, ideas of the Enlightenment influenced Spanish speakers to challenge ruling structures, including Spain's monarchic rule in the Americas. Over the course of the 19th century, the majority of Spain's former colonies would become independent nations while others transitioned into different colonial regimes. We will look at the efforts of Latin American and Spanish artists and intellectuals who lived through these historical changes to define national, regional, and individual identities through writing and other means. \nTEXT: There is no required textbook. Course readings will be made available online. \nPARTICULARS: Evaluation is based on active class participation, short writing assignments, and four essays, to be revised with peer feedback.
