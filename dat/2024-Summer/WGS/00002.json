    "class_notes": "This class will explore the social and rhetorical impact of manifestos. We will read famous political (feminist, queer, and artistic/cinematic) manifestos and explore how they use text or image to make their claims. Target texts will include: The Communist Manifesto (Karl Marx); The SCUM Manifesto (Valerie Solanas); Preliminary notes for a BLACK MANIFESTO (Rasheed Araeen); What We Believe (Black Lives Matter); Principles of Countersexual Society (Paul Preciado); The Motion Picture Production Code; I Want A President (Zoe Leonard); Preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray (Oscar Wilde). We will watch Julian Rosefeldt's video installation Manifesto, we will access manifestos held in the Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book collections at Emory's Rose Library, and we will visit Kara Walker's The Jubilant Martyrs of Obsolescence and Ruin (installed at Atlanta's High Museum). This interdisciplinary class is designed for students in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences who would like to think about the power of political writing and experiment with the form of the manifesto. For assessment students will compose their own written, sound or image manifesto.",
