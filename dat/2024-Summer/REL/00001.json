    "class_notes": "This course satisfies the new Religion major requirement: - Theme.\nThis Introduction to Religion is centered on religious violence and conflict, ranging from more or less civil disagreements to ever-worse behavior, including religious violence. We question the concept of \"religious violence,' as well as problematic terms such as 'cult,' 'terrorism' and 'holy war.' Is religion to blame for violence\" Might we say, if a religion is violent, perhaps it is not true religion? If people who kill others think what they were doing is 'religious' (or 'sacred') - what do we do with this claim? We will also look at polemics and inter-religious disagreement (mainly Buddhist/Christian debates), and at the relation of attacks on people and attacks on symbolic objects. We will look at examples from Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, and Islam. \nThe study of religion is essential in today's world because we humans as a species seem to be so bad at disagreeing. On the one hand, we are called to make a judgement of our own. On the other hand, we can hardly understand the phenomena of religious violence if we simply condemn it as 'evil' 'we have to understand what we don't agree with. We have to allow ourselves to follow the train of thought, even while we consider it to be wrong. When 'disagreement' involves mass murder, our capacity to understand is stretched to breaking point. \nAssessment will include comments on readings, a paper, a take-home final reflection, attendance and participation.\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
