    "class_notes": "This course satisfies the Religion major requirement:- Tradition-Christianity, Theme. \nThe history of religions in the United States provides a diverse landscape to study. Immigration, missions, nation-building, music, urbanization, oppression, gender politics, civil religion, solitary seekers, social experimentation, and consumer culture - it's all there, and more.  Religious lives and practices reflect a broad array of circumstances, communities, and commodities.  Materials and discussions in this course will cover both so-called religious traditions in the American context (Hinduism, Judaism, Native American, and so on), and less recognized but just as vital religious cultures alive and thriving in the American context. This online course will also address conflicting definitions of 'religion' at work in American history, and question lines of authority and power in making distinctions between real religion and false religion.\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
