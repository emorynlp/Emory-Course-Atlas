It is vital to understand what forces shape visual culture and how it shapes our thinking about a myriad of topics such as politics, race, class, and gender. In this class we will explore the ways visual culture is produced, circulated, and consumed. We will explore visual culture in multiple mediums including art, architecture, photography, comics, digital media, advertising, and television. We will begin by studying the major theories behind visual culture. We will consider how issues of authority, power, and positionality shape the creation and interpretation of visual images. Students will become adept at \"reading\" visual images in the same way they read other texts, and the discussion-based course will give students ample opportunity to hone this skill. We will conduct a case study of visual images and representations of Islam and Muslims in multiple modalities.",
