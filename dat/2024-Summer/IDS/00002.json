    "class_notes": "F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby has been a staple of U.S. high school curricula since the 1960's, characterized as the \"Great American Novel,\" or celebrated as a glimpse into the luxury of the \"roaring 20's\" or the \"Jazz Age.\" Yet the novel seethes with half-cooked White Supremacist ideas, spouted by the repulsive character Tom Buchanan, and poignantly plays with racist stereotypes. This course will use Gatsby as a fulcrum to investigate literature and events of the 1920's in the U.S., a decade marked by intense racial violence, like the Tulsa Race Massacre and lynching, and strategies of resistance, such as passing, a theme reflected in literary works such as James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man. Some have argued that Gatsby himself can be understood as a Black man passing as White. Among other novels and films, we will also look at the 2002 film adaptation of Gatsby, G, which retells the story in a hip-hop setting.",
