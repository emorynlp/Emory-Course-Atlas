    "course_description": "We live in a noisy world - the average person encounters 6,000-10,000 ads in a single day, and our attention spans have perfected the art of tuning out. Becoming a compelling storyteller is your best chance to break through. Content Marketing will take you through the process of both creating and distribution content. For distribution content, we examine digital ecosystems - the why and how. For creating content, we leverage the science of sticky ideas, storytelling through screenplays and put principle into practice through a viral social media experiment.",
