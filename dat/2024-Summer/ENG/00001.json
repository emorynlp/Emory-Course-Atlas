    "class_notes": "This is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.\n\n\nStudies in poetry and poetic forms. Readings may vary in individual sections, but all sections emphasize critical reading and writing about poetic art. Required for English majors.  Most of the poems will be taken from a chronological anthology of English poetry in order to give a sense of literary history and of changes in poetic form and content over time.  Familiarity with poetic terminology is a primary goal.  Close readings of poems will become the subjects of the papers, such that students can learn to write about poetry with interpretive skill.  This is not a course in writing poetry creatively, though there will be creative imitation exercises.",
