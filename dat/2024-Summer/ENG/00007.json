    "class_notes": "This is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.\n\n\nThis writing-intensive course provides students with an introduction to Shakespeare's dramatic works across four genres: history, comedy, tragedy, and romance. Our live meetings will be divided between historically oriented lectures and close reading of key passages. We will read Shakespeare's work against the backdrop of the English Renaissance, especially the vibrant, commercial theatre scene in early modern London, and the political climate of Tudor-Stuart England. We will consider these works as texts to be read and plays to be performed, with synchronous and asynchronous activities that ask you to consider the textual, performance, and adaptation history of select plays as well as their distinctly literary aspects. And we will explore Shakespeare's complex and enduring influence over literature, film, culture, and everyday life. Assignments include a passage analysis, a performance/film review, a commonplace book, and regular reading responses.",
