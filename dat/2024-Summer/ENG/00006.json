    "class_notes": "This course covers the history of manuscript and book production.  We meet in the Special Collections of Emory's Rose Library and the Candler Theology School's Pitts Library where we will engage with full scale color facsimiles of medieval manuscripts, early printed books, and with a selection of original materials.  We will learn paleographic skills \"the ability to read and interpret medieval and early modern documents\" and come face to face with the means and modes of textual production over a time span of 1300 years. What can manuscripts do that printed books cannot, and vice versa? What tricks and methods could a web designer borrow from a medieval scribe or a fifteenth-century printer? In the first week you will choose a manuscript or book to work on through a succession of staged assignments, leading to a final presentation. The class meets a continuing communications requirement.",
