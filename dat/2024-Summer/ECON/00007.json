    "class_notes": "Gender Economics\nYou often hear of the gender wage gap. How big is it? What causes it?\nWhat happens with boys and girls in early education? Are boys performing better or worse? And by how much? Does this happen everywhere in the world? Why are more women enrolling in colleges but not in the work force?\nIn this course we are going to start by questioning our priors on the numbers related to gender and many socio-economic characteristics. And then we will look at the data and the literature that examines these topics and answers the questions above. Students will finish this course with hands on experience looking at the literature and the data on gender economics. \nThis class provides students with valuable information and eye opening facts, about the world biases that affects us all since early ages. There will be fun discussions all hands-on data analysis. \nTopics from these two interesting and fun books will be covered: \nOf boys and men by Richards Reeves \nInvisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez",
