The purpose of this course is to prepare the student for actual analysis of epidemiologic data from case-control or cohort studies. It demonstrates, and gives the student an opportunity to explore, the methods taught in the epidemiology methods sequence. The student will develop a hypothesis, and test it using an epidemiologic database with stratified analysis and logistic regression techniques. The student also will use conditional logistic regression. It is expected that this course will help prepare Executive MPH students for analyzing their thesis data.",
