Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
    "course_description": "CHEM 205 will address the origins of electronic orbitals and the quantized energy states associated with molecular motions. How light causes transitions between energy levels will be central to our discussion, illuminating topics from spectroscopy to the Earth's climate and solar energy conversion.",
