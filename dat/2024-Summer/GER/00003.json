    "class_notes": "This course introduces the basics of German grammar and intensively practices reading and translation skills (rather than speaking). It is intended to prepare graduate level students to engage with texts written in German from their field of study, however undergraduates are also welcome to attend. In this course, you will be actively working on translations of texts in your field of study and learn how to both get the gist of a text, and how to perform close reading.\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.\n\n\nThis is an online course.
