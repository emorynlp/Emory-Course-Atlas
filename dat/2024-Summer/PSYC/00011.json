In this course we will examine the tension between Individualist versus Collectivist identities in American films of the 1970s. This was a particularly fruitful period for such exploration given the vast societal changes and social upheaval that took place in American society at the time and the ways in which it motivated individuals to rethink the possibilities for the various aspects of their identities. Together we will view a selection of films that illustrate the tension between these aspects of individuals' identities, with a particular focus on Individualist versus Collectivist identities. In addition to looking back on the 1970s we will discuss the applicability of this tension to present-day American society and current events.\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
