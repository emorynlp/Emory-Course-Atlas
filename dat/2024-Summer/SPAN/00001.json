    "class_notes": "This is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.\n\n\nSpanish 101 is a beginning-level integrated skills language course for students with no background in Spanish or only one year of high-school Spanish. The goals of this course include learning to use Spanish to communicate, learning of and about the tools of communication, and studying Hispanic cultures to begin to understand how culture affects language use. Students participate in paired, small-group and whole-class conversation/listening activities that focus on meaningful communication. Along with daily activities and readings, students will submit unit projects through Contrase単a and take quizzes via Canvas.\n\n\nREQUIRED COURSE MATERIAL: Contrase単a: Your Passport to Foundational Spanish (LingroLearning). Contrase単a is a completely mobile and digital immersive experience, so there is no required printed textbook. Access is available for purchase directly from LingroLearning at www.lingrolearning.com\nPARTICULARS: Classes are conducted in Spanish to maximize exposure to the language. Evaluation is based on daily and active participation, online homework assignments, portfolio projects (Contrase単a), and quizzes (Canvas). Please note that this course requires a significant amount of asynchronous work, in addition to the required synchronous sessions.\nPREREQUISITES: Official Spanish Placement into SPAN 101 from the Department of Spanish and Portuguese.
