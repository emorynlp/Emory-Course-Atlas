    "class_notes": "This is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.\n\n\nThis course is a continuation of Spanish 101 and is an integrated-skills course designed to further promote basic communication in and with Hispanic communities and to heighten cultural awareness. The goals of this course include learning to use Spanish to communicate (through intensive interaction), primarily in speaking and listening, but also in reading and writing; learning of and about the tools of communication, including pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary; and continuing the study of Hispanic cultures to learn more about how culture affects language use. Students participate in paired, small-group and whole-class conversation/listening activities that focus on meaningful communication. Along with daily activities and readings, students will submit unit projects through Contrase単a and take quizzes or submit discussions via Canvas.\n\n\nREQUIRED COURSE MATERIAL: Contrase単a: Your Passport to Foundational Spanish (LingroLearning). Contrase単a is a completely mobile and digital immersive experience, so there is no required printed textbook. Access is available for purchase directly from LingroLearning at www.lingrolearning.com\nPARTICULARS: Classes are conducted in Spanish to maximize exposure to the language. Evaluation is based on daily and active participation, online homework assignments, portfolio projects (Contrase単a), and quizzes or discussions (Canvas). Please note that this course requires a significant amount of asynchronous work, in addition to the required synchronous sessions.\nPREREQUISITES: SPAN 101 or SPAN_OX 101.\nContact sharlene.arruda.mendes@emory.edu for enrollment.",
