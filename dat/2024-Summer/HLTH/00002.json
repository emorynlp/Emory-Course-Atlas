    "class_notes": "At the individual, community, national and global level, we will examine the evidentiary support for sustaining regular physical activity and healthy eating patterns across all ages. We will study the relationship to risk, prevention, and recurrence of non-communicable diseases and negative health outcomes (examples will include but are not limited to; cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep, depression, and anxiety). We will also consider the potential negative health impact of physical inactivity, prolonged sitting, and unhealthy eating patterns. Students who enroll in this course should possess a strong curiosity in understanding these behaviors within a transdisciplinary framework and beyond the established, customary proposed benefits. Topics of investigation will be presented through an interdisciplinary perspective utilizing lectures and group discussions, individual and group projects, and community engagement. No textbook is required for this course.\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
