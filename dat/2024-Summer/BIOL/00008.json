    "class_notes": "The cell is an amazing network of self-organizing machinery that drives life in all its forms. This course begins by defining the molecular wheels and cogs of the cell's machines and how their capabilities are defined by their chemistries. The chemistries of each component are then explored to understand how they contribute to the operation and control of the cellular machinery. We will further explore how all of the cellular components are governed, by kinetic and non-kinetic controls, to produce a coherent and responsive metabolism that efficiently creates and utilizes the energy stored in chemical compounds, such as glucose and fats. Human metabolic disorders such as diabetes will provide models of how metabolism is controlled at the systematic level in complex organisms using biochemical signaling pathways to coordinate metabolic pathways in different tissues. Prerequisites: Biology 142, 142L, and Chemistry 203. This course will fulfill elective credit for the Biology major and should provide students with a firm foundation in Biochemistry.\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
