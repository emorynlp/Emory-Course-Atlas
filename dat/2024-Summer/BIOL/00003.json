    "class_notes": "This is the first semester of a two-semester introductory biology course that is required for all Biology majors. This courses will provide a topic-driven overview of evolution, molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, genetics, and ecology. The topics covered in LECTURE will address major issues in human biology, medicine, evolution, and ecology, with an emphasis on the basic principles and critical thinking involved in modern biological discovery. Students must also register for a BIOLOGY 141 Laboratory (BIOL 141L). In LAB, students will design and perform experiments using several important model systems. These courses include classical and molecular genetics and meet the biology premedical requirements. Some exams may be administered in the evening. AP Biology scores of 4 or 5 count for the Biology 141 LECTURE ONLY. Students with AP credit for the lecture are required to take the Lab (BIOL 141L). Co-requisite: Biology 141L.\n\n\nThis is an ONLINE course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
