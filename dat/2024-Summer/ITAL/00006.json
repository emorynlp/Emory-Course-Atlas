This is an offer you can't refuse. Touching on witchcraft, the evil eye, and life in Little Italy, you will learn whether Alfredo Sauce is authentically Italian and what it meant to be an Italian immigrant at the turn of the 20th century. Several millions of Italian immigrants came to the United States to work for the industrial development of the county's economy at the end of the 19th century. This course aims at introducing you to the fascinating study of the Italian American presence in the United States and its impact. Through movies, articles and primary sources we will look at the historical, political, literary and artistic achievements of Italian immigrants in the United States to understand what it means to be an American of Italian descent in the 21st century.",
