In order to develop the relationship between creative reading practices and creative writing practices, we will read and discuss books by a number of 20th and 21st century poets whose work will guide our discussion of poetic techniques and aesthetic practices. We will study these poets in order to study our own interests, intentions, and practices as writers. In particular, we will explore and critique the concept of 'other lineages,' of the various micro-traditions and aesthetic affiliations that exist between poets. Students should expect to devote themselves to a practice of reading and writing and be prepared for mature discussions of complex material. We will write new poems in correspondence with the material we read, recite poems, engage with poets' archival materials in Emory's Rose Library, create a poetics statement, and produce chapbooks of our own poetry.",
