Our additional textbook will be Flash Fiction International.\nThere are short writing assignments tied to these readings. Each student in the class will be asked to write two short original works of fiction as well as a handful of flash fiction stories.\n \nAll student stories will be treated in a workshop setting. The workshop is designed to both acknowledge the positive attributes of a story as well as identify areas of a story that might be improved. A traditional-length short story written for this class should run from 5-12 pages (typed, double-spaced), though said story might also be a little shorter or a little longer. No novel excerpts, please.\nHopefully, by the end of the term, students will wind up with a meaningful understanding of the art of short story writing.",
