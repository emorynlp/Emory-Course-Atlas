    "course_description": "Advanced topics and tools for analysis of decision problems, focusing on modeling the real-world complications.  We address the issues of: too many alternatives (leading us to resource pricing, linear programming using optimization techniques);  aversion to risk (utility); multiple, conflicting objectives (multi-attribute decision making and value-focused thinking); and too many, complex outcomes (Monte Carlo simulation). The primary course objective is to improve managerial effectiveness through clearer thinking about complex decision issues, and through the application of powerful analytical tools to a wide variety of common management problems.",
