    "class_notes": "Complete Topic: Race and the American Dream: Gatsby, Immigration, Passing, and Literature of the 1920s \nF. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby has been a staple of U.S. high school curricula since the 1960's, characterized as the \"Great American Novel,\" or celebrated as a glimpse into the luxury of the \"roaring 20's\" or the \"Jazz Age.\" Yet the novel seethes with half-cooked White Supremacist ideas, spouted by the repulsive character Tom Buchanan, and poignantly plays with racist stereotypes. This course will use Gatsby as a fulcrum to investigate literature and events of the 1920's in the U.S., a decade marked by intense racial violence, like the Tulsa Race Massacre and lynching, anti-immigrant legislation and violence, and strategies of resistance, such as passing, a theme reflected in literary works such as James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man and Nella Larsen's Passing, the basis of a well reviewed 2021 film; we will study both the novel and the film. Some have argued that Gatsby himself can be understood as a Black man passing as White. We will also look at the 2002 film adaptation of Gatsby, G, which retells the story in a hip-hop setting.\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
