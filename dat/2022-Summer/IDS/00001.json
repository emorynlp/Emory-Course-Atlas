    "class_notes": "Complete Topic:  Imaging Equality: Visual Culture from Civil Rights to Black Lives Matter\nHow can visual culture help us understand the fight for racial justice? How do photographs, films, and works of art inspire people to take action? How do images tell the story of struggle and triumph? How can images be used to both encourage and inhibit social change? How does the visual culture of the Black Lives Matter movement grow out of and build upon the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s? In this interdisciplinary course we will seek to answer these questions and others using the lens of visual culture to examine the history, influence, and legacy of the Civil Rights movement. We will begin by understanding key theories behind the study of both visual culture and race and then apply these theories as we analyze a variety of visual materials including photography, art, news, and digital media. You will become adept at 'reading' visual images in the same way that you would read other texts, and the discussion-based nature of our synchronous meetings will give you ample opportunity to hone this skill. In addition, short visual and textual assignments in addition to a larger, final project will offer you the opportunity to apply your skills and knowledge.\n\n\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.",
