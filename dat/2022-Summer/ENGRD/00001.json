Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.\n\n\nIn this writing-intensive and participation-driven course, we will collaboratively examine the contexts for and rhetorical dimensions of diverse professional documents primarily, those you will produce this term. Major assignments include career materials (resume, cover letter, and/or personal statements), a research report analyzing workplace writing, and a project presenting a professional passion in multimodal form (podcast, video, infographic, etc.). Through practice and discussion, we will explore the nature of professionalism and strategies for producing ethical, effective, and efficient professional writing.",
