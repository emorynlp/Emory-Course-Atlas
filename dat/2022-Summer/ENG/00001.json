Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.\n\n\n(Course Topic: The Poetry of Love and Desire) In this course, we will study some of the most beautiful and challenging poetry written in English. Discussions will address a deceptively simple question: why is poetry so often about love? Starting with the Sonnets of William Shakespeare and working our way towards the present, we will explore how poetry attempts to capture experiences that can feel 'beyond' the reach of ordinary language: romantic love and sexual desire, but also other forms of love such as love for nature or for the divine. Assignments include short essays and a reading journal. ENG 205W fulfills a requirement for the English major or English minor",
