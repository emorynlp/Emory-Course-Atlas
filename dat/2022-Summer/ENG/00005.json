    "class_notes": "(Same as HIST 396W 1)\nThis is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.\n\n\nJane Austen and Charles Dickens offer novels filled with vivid descriptions of life during their respective eras. Key to their fiction are representations of the excesses and deprivations associated with people of diverse economic circumstances.\nIn this online course, we will read and write about food practices during the English Regency and Victorian periods, with special attention to items appearing, or implied-- in the literature of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens and in the culinary texts available from the kitchens in both authors, households. Dickens, by the way, does not only present the gruel we see in Oliver Twist, he also has 4 servants assigned to the making and serving of hot chocolate in A Tale of Two Cities, illustrating how wealth and poverty influence food options. We will also investigate the introduction and reception of foods from other cultures. In our asynchronous classes, we will enjoy podcasts and films related to period farming, kitchens, feasts, and times of need. We will also cook! (alternative assignments will be available for those without access to kitchen facilities). Although we do not have ready access to historically accurate cooking conditions, we will take advantage of the many resources available to recreate foods, drinks, and delicacies from these periods. We will also explore the ways Austen and Dickens incorporate food and beverages into their novels.",
