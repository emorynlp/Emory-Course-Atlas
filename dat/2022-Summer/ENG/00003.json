Full participation in synchronous sessions is required (meeting times listed are local to Atlanta), and students should plan to spend at least 15-20 hours/week on the course. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.\n\n\nIn this course, we will study Rowling's Harry Potter series, both in terms of its literary value and because the novels are excellent examples of the ways in which texts in our society are read, reread, interpreted, and used. We will discuss the texts in terms of their rhetorical arguments, their historical context, the literary and philosophical tropes they employ, and readers, responses to them. These texts tell us a great deal about our society and our selves; that's what we are here to investigate.",
