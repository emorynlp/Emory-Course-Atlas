Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term.\n\n\n\"Development\" - efforts to reduce or eradicate poverty, hunger, social and political inequalities, and human rights abuses through progressive social, economic, and political change has been a key project of the post-World War II era. Its significance has become even greater in light of growing income disparities, declining standards of living, and the persistence of violence around the globe. At the same time, new technologies and the globalization of markets have offered greater opportunities for connectivity, communication, and the flow of people and resources-with mixed effects on poverty and well-being. This introductory course for the Global Development Studies minor at Emory offers students a chance to explore the theory, practice, and profession of international development. How can we understand and address growing inequality? What ideas, strategies, and concepts have organized the project of development since the post-war period? And how can we approach development issues in a more humanistic, compassionate way that is respectful of cultural differences and the rights of the poor to a dignified, meaningful life?\n\n\nThis course will introduce students to the growing field of development studies and provide a solid foundation for subsequent course work in the Minor and, eventually, possible career tracks. It will provide an overview of how scholars and practitioners research and apply their knowledge toward understanding and solving some of the world's most challenging problems. Through readings and class discussion, students will learn about several key topics related to development, including human rights, gender, environment, poverty and inequality, democratic reforms and governance, market reforms, rural development, and conflict.",
