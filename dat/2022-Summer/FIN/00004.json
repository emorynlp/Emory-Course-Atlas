    "course_description": "Economics is the study of how best to allocate scarce resources. Typically, the focus of economics coursework (especially undergraduate) is on how governments/societies can  best meet the needs of a population given its human, financial, and natural resource constraints. In  an MBA program, the study of economics is aimed at the decisions that managers make, both short  term and long term, to maximize the value of the firm. The objectives of this course are to show  you how elements of microeconomics can be applied to managerial decision­making and to prepare  you for subsequent courses in the MBA curriculum by giving you a foundation in microeconomic  theory.",
