The social ecological model provides the conceptual framework for the course with an emphasis on the importance of primary prevention.  Students will gain an understanding of how factors at the individual, intrapersonal, community and public policy levels interact to influence health over the life course.  The course introduces theories at each of these levels and how to use these theories to inform intervention design.  It includes a review of risk factors for the leadings causes of morbidity and mortality and a detailed discussion of how social and economic inequalities and other factors influence health (e.g., social class, culture, race/ethnicity, and gender).  The course concludes with a discussion of translating knowledge to action and bringing evidence-based interventions to scale.",
