The student will draw from various subject matters and explore a variety of media, techniques, and concepts. Students will demonstrate an understanding of the formal elements (line, shape, value, and texture) as they relate to the principles of visual organization (harmony, balance, rhythm, and repetition, movement, dominance, and proportion). The foci of the studio will be the exploration of the formal elements of art in relation to constructing strong compositions and the study of the aesthetic, physical, and psychological properties of value and texture.",
