    "class_notes": "This course is a seminar style course that focuses on the interplay of major global health actors/players, the politics of global health, and the power dynamics that infuse the interplay. The course will concentrate on key global health players over the last 25 years including public, multilateral, private and philanthropic players. The landscape of global health was framed by the post-World War 2 set of organizations and institutions. Over the last 25 years and particularly since the millennium the landscape has fundamentally changed. This course will explore the dynamics of this change, the influence of respective global health players in crafting the global health agenda and the relative power of each player over time. A key focus of this course will interrogate the question of whether and how the priorities and politics of the big global health players influence decisions taken at community, sub-national and national levels in low and middle income countries. The course will require a significant amount of reading, critique, discussion and analysis. (Prerequisite: HLTH 250)",
