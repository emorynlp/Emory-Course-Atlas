    "class_notes": "Malnutrition is \"poor, nutrition\" due either to excesses or deficiencies.  Historically, obesity was a problem exclusive to high-income countries and undernutrition was a problem exclusive to low- and middle-income countries.  With the growing global obesity epidemic, diet-related non-communicable diseases are increasingly important causes of illness and death in low-and middle-income countries.  These countries have a health infrastructure developed to address undernutrition, which remains a public health problem, while simultaneously having to contend with the growing challenge of over nutrition. In this course, we will explore different measures, causes, and consequences of undernutrition and over nutrition, and interventions to prevent them.  Building on this base, we will critique interventions that improve one type of malnutrition while inadvertently contributing to another kind of malnutrition.  And, we will examine options for reducing both types of malnutrition at the same time. There are two main goals in this course.  The first is for students to be able to identify if either or both types of malnutrition exist in individuals, households or populations.  The second is to provide students with the skills and practice in developing interventions that simultaneously reduce both forms of malnutrition.",
