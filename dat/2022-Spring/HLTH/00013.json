As a result of broad-scale environmental damage, from climate change to biodiversity loss, as well as the resultant social and political response, diverse flows of economic, forced, and irregular migration has increased in extent and complexity.  This course will explore the underlying environmental, economic, political and social causes of migration and its effect on the health of migrant communities.  We will explore several case studies of migration that span the various causes and consequences of migration, to include in-country and trans-boundary migration. (Prerequisite: HLTH 250)",
