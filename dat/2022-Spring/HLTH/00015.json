The course will include the history of the methods' practice, foundational theories and principles, various approaches used, and an exploration of these techniques' effect on human health and wellness. In addition to traditional lecture, classes will involve learning through participation in drama therapy warm-ups, techniques, and processing. As the course is primarily experiential, it is crucial that students attend regularly and participate in activities and group discussions. No previous training in theatre or drama therapy is necessary.",
