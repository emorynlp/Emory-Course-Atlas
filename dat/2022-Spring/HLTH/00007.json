It uses didactic and applied training to develop competency in research methods, both quantitative and qualitative. The course introduces the basic steps, methods and strategies of the research process; problem identification, hypothesis development, literature review, research design and methodology, data management, data analysis, and scientific communication. Its aim is to help students design and develop a thoughtful, persuasive, and potentially fundable scientific research proposal that addresses a health concern. Students begin with a broad health topic that they would like to investigate and learn how to narrow it down into a specific and feasible research question; then they learn how to design a methodology to address the question. In addition to comprehending and developing the elements of a research project, students also learn the principles of ethical conduct of research, essentials of scientific writing, as well as presentation skills. Students also learn how to conduct a literature review, how to evaluate the literature, and how to use a reference management software. \n(Prerequisite: HLTH 207, OR QTM100, OR MATH_OX 117Q, OR ECON 220)",
