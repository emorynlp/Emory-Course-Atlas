There has been a proliferation of concepts and theories of melancholy over thousands of years, with each discourse relating in different ways to broader social, philosophical, and artistic concerns. This Freshman seminar offers a comparative survey of these discourses and their related issues: ideological, social, aesthetic, and scientific, from the Ancient Greeks onwards. We will focus on the ways in which melancholy has been thought and theorized in medicine, theology, psychoanalysis, psychiatry, ethnography, and philosophy; on how it raises crucial problems related to politics, society, culture, and gender; and on the modes through which melancholy has been felt and expressed in literature, visual art, music, and social media. Required Texts: (1) Sartre, Nausea - 9780811220309; (2) Radden, The Nature of Melancholy - 0195151658",
