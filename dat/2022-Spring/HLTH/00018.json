Similarly, early life malnutrition can have lifelong consequences. As such, maternal and child malnutrition remains a leading risk factor for disability-adjusted life years. This course will explore the biological basis for unique nutritional requirements during the perinatal period and in childhood, and will use a lifecourse perspective to examine inter-generational effects of over- and under-nutrition. We will also discuss evidence-based approaches to improve maternal and child nutrition in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. (prerequisite: HLTH 220)",
