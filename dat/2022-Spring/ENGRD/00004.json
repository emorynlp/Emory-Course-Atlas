Contact Jane O'Connor jcoconn@emory.edu for permission to enroll.\n\n\nCommunication Across Borders - In this continuing writing course for English language learners, we will discuss key aspects of translation and cross-cultural communication. What happens when we translate arguments and ideas across countries and cultures? How do people of different backgrounds communicate with each other? What makes these interactions effective or ineffective? We will talk about what might be gained and lost in moments of cross-cultural and/or transnational communication, and we will address responsibilities and opportunities for the individuals and groups engaging in communicative endeavors. We will read/listen/watch different relevant materials that encourage students to reflect on these issues and themes. Through a variety of tasks and assignments, students will have the chance to improve their own writing and communication skills.",
