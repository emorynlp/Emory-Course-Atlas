Consider this, why were African slaves forbidden to learn to read and write in the United States? Why did Victorian doctors link women's independent reading to physical maladies like insanity and infertility? This class investigates literacy practices as rhetorical endeavors of resistance to power structures that attempted to control and deprive certain populations from the pleasure and agency of meaning-making. Through informal, formal, and multimodal assignments, students will develop a strong foundational knowledge of rhetorical theory through a thematic study of the literacy practices of figures like Frederick Douglass, Malcolm X, Paulo Freire, Malala Yousafzai, Mary Daly, and others.",
