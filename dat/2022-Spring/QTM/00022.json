This class would not be covering models that are used in social science as comprehensive as a stand alone causal analysis class; nor would the class be covering models in ML as comprehensive as a stand alone ML class. The objective of this class is to understand the use-cases where ML algorithms effectively complement existing statistical methods, and to build abilities to combine the two different areas, methodologies (if required) to better answer the questions using the data.",
