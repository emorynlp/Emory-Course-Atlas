This course is targeted at examining and understanding the institution of slavery in Islamic societies. It offers strong foundations to discuss slavery in the two main sources of law in Islam: Qur''n and Sunna. Then it offers a survey of the most important aspects of slavery, including the geographical origins of the slave population, their numbers and demographics in Islamic lands, labor conditions, as well as production and reproduction characteristics. Through a thematic examination, the course presents some of the most distinctive types of slavery that existed in different part of Islamic lands: military slavery, harem slavery, eunuchs, etc. Also this course examines debates on the abolition of the institution of slavery; the colonial context in which it emerged and was imposed; and the way Muslim intellectuals adopted abolitionist ideas. By the end of the semester, the focus will be on the diaspora and the structural inequalities inherited from slavery and perpetuated to these days. It will also touch on the contemporary forms of slavery in the lands of Islam.",
