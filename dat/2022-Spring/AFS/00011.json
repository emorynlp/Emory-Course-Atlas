We will consider social, political, economic, religious, and cultural experiences of women, including North and Sub-Saharan Africa. We will read primary and secondary sources, with the goal of understanding historical changes and problematizing ahistorical gender analysis. Much of our reading and discussion will focus on the pre-1900 period. Gender will be a central concept, since we will consider women's interactions with men and children. This seminar is concerned with the historical forces shaping African women's lives, as well as with the ways in which women have been active historical agents. Student will work on individual research project.",
