Seeks to interrogate assumptions - about personhood and power, religion and magic, tradition and modernity - that have long precluded understanding African societies in their own contexts and on their own terms. Readings are primarily anthropological, but also draw from history, philosophy, and fiction.\n\n\n(Same as  REL 270 1 &ANT 285 3)",
