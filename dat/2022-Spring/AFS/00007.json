We will examine the birth and the intersections of influential AfroCuban religions that have shaped Cuban aesthetics, emerging in literary texts, visual arts, and musical compositions, but also in philosophical essays analyzing national culture. We will examine how, throughout history, African religious thought has shaped and developed into AfroCuban aesthetics, and how it has significantly influenced postcolonial cultural expressions/artistic representations in the island.",
