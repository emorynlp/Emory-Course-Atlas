As we explore the artistic achievements of Portuguese writers and filmmakers over the last one hundred years, students examine Salazar's Estado Novo and Portugal's transition to democracy. The selected literary and cultural texts serve as vehicles for a deeper understanding of contemporary Portuguese society. Our goal is to evaluate how literature and film contest hegemonic accounts, to investigate how artistic productions play a role in interpreting Portugal's past and to examine the interconnections between history, memory, and national identity. TEXTS: Course Packet PARTICULARS: Evaluation is based on daily and active participation; journals; short essays, oral presentations, comparative analytical project; and Portuguese program activities.
