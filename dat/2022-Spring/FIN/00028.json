    "course_description": "Generally speaking, project finance refers to financings where the terms and conditions of the debt are directly related to the specific purpose for which the proceeds will be used. In project financing lenders often rely only on the cash flows of those projects for repayment and have no recourse to the broader balance sheet of the sponsoring corporation.  Project financing activities are often referred to as \"structured finance\" since the repayment schedule and covenant packages for this debt are likely to reflect specific project cash flows or other characteristics of the assets being financed.",
