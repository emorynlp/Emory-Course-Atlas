We first briefly introduce the major works of queer theory, including queer of color critique. We then read some prominent texts in queer theology and consider how they might contribute to some perennial debates in Christian theology: eros and agape, sin and sexuality, pleasure and asceticism, dissent and sainthood, apophatic theology, and utopic eschatology. Finally, we engage some new works in this nascent field: trans-theology, queer environmentalism and anti-capitalism, queer sexual ethics, inclusive Christian ministry (with invited speaker Bishop Yvette Flunder), theology during the AIDS epidemic, and queer spiritualties within and beyond Christianity.",
