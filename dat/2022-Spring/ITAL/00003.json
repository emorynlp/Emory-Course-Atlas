    "class_notes": "ITAL 190: Social Justice in Italy and Beyond through Memoir  \n \nContent: A memoir, whether one essay or a book, concentrates on a moment that resonates, a dramatic incident, a time when something came into focus, a journey that changed the author. The most effective memoirs explore what the author can't stop thinking about yet cannot fully grasp. In writing, the memoirist both relates what happened and discovers new meaning. This course will introduce you to memoir through the lens of social justice movements in Italy and beyond. Class discussions and assignments will focus on the literary qualities of each text and explore topics specific to memoir and your own lives. The class is designed to develop your critical faculties, to help you become better readers and writers, and to advance your ability to discuss, assess, and write about world events and learn about Italian culture, social justice movements, and yourselves in the process. You will have the opportunity to write short pieces about yourselves, imitating the varied styles of our Italian memoirists as well as exploring poignant moments of your own lives. Key to our discussions will be your understanding of each memoir's form, structure, historical placement, cultural context, and content: how the story is told, the way it is told, and what it communicates about social justice and the author who wrote it.   \nBooks: Course Reader",
