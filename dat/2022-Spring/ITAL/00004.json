ITAL202 is designed to help students build communication skills in Italian. We emphasize all four language skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing, as well as cross-cultural competency. By the end of the semester, students should be able to (a) interact successfully in Italian, (b) understand a majority of what they hear and read in Italian, and (c) express themselves clearly in spoken and written Italian.\nPrerequisites: Italian 201 or instructor's approval. \nRequired Texts: New Italian Espresso Intermediate / Advanced. Alma Edizioni (ISBN: 9788861825710)",
    "course_description": "Utilizing authentic texts, this engaging content-based approach to language learning focuses on a historically sequenced in-depth study of Italian art, history, and literature, developing analytical-critical skills, cross-cultural competency and higher than norm linguistic fluency.",
