    "class_notes": "This course will introduce students to major works of British literature (including poetry, drama, and prose) dating roughly from the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603 to the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. We will adopt a broadly historicist approach, devoting special attention to the relation between the period's literature and the politics of the English Civil War (1642-1651). This approach, however, will not be at the expense of attention to the formal and thematic qualities of individual works. The course will be divided into six units: 1) Metaphysical and Cavalier Poetry, 2) Jacobean Drama, 3) Gender Relations in the Seventeenth Century, 4) Empiricism and Experience, 5) The Literature of the Civil War, and 6) Milton's Paradise Lost.",
