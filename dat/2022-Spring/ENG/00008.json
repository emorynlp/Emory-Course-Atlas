These texts, written over a span of 3 centuries by American writers of diverse backgrounds and in diverse genres, illustrate a pattern of playful questioning with regards to gender and sex epistemologies-or knowledge systems-that inform the way we understand, perform, and even feel about these binaries that are so crucial to both subjective and collective identity formation. In addition to learning about trans and intersex issues in the American context, you will learn strategies for close reading literary texts, and produce at least 20 pages of writing.",
