Through readings from prominent authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, William Faulkner, Shirley Jackson, Stephen King, and Jesmyn Ward, we will discuss the tropes and styles that characterize American gothic and Southern gothic literature. In addition to thinking about the devices these authors use to generate uncanny sensations for their readers, we will consider how they work within the gothic mode to comment on contemporaneous social and political issues. We will practice responding to literature through a sequence of critical and creative assignments, including a close reading, a short story, and a research paper.",
