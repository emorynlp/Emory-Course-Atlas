    "class_notes": "This course covers the full range of Geoffrey Chaucer's poetry, including his dream visions, Troilus and Criseyde and selected Canterbury Tales. Chaucer creates in English the stories and forms found in classical (e.g. Ovid's Metamorphoses and Virgil's Aeneid), vernacular (e.g. those by Dante, Boccaccio, and Guillaume de Lorris) and biblical traditions. Chaucer is at his best when overturning the conventions of epic, romance, fabliau, Breton lay, saint's life, and exemplum.  We shall explore at least three of the great mysteries of Chaucer's life and work: how such a prolific poet could also be a soldier, diplomat, and court official; how his poetic persona consistently veils and deprecates his genius; and how his relationships with women find poetic expression. A class project will involve work with manuscript facsimiles in Emory's Rose Library. \n \nRequirements: three six-page papers, manuscript project, Canvas posts, final examination. \nTexts:  The following Norton Critical Editions: Troilus and Criseyde, ed. Barney; The Canterbury Tales, ed. Kolve and Olson; Dream Visions and Other Poems, ed. Lynch.",
