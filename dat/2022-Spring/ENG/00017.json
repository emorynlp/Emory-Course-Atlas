Shakespearean productions range widely: Ian McKellen is currently playing Hamlet on stage at age 81; Hamlet also appears in Gilligan's Island and The Simpsons. We will be watching performances (live if possible) and will take advantage of the wide range of fascinating podcasts devoted to Shakespearean topics. Regular writing assignments and active involvement in class discussions will be required. You will be able to use any copies of Shakespeare's texts (library volumes encouraged), so long as they are in Shakespeare's language and include Act, Scene, and Line numbers. Students from all disciplinary backgrounds are welcome and there will be opportunities for cross-disciplinary work for those who are interested.",
