    "class_notes": "This course will provide an overview of literature from a particularly complex period in American history. Readings will include essays, poems, short stories, and novels by authors such as Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Harriet Jacobs, Frederick Douglass, Herman Melville, Frances Harper, and Mark Twain. We will consider these texts from historical, stylistic, and theoretical perspectives, with a focus on the question of what literature is uniquely capable of teaching us about the politics and culture of an era. We will discuss, as well, how many of the themes and issues raised in these texts remain relevant in contemporary America. We will practice responding to literature through a sequence of writing assignments, which will include a close reading, a creative response piece, and a research paper.",
