This seminar might explore: the emergence of \"digital humanities\" as a capacious field; new media, electronic literature, games, and gamification; digitization and archives; data visualization; and computational modeling as it helps us explore both key questions in the humanities, and in thinking about computation and the digital. We will investigate debates internal to the field over representation and the use and abuse of algorithms and machine learning; critical race studies; feminism and queer theory; digital pedagogy; disciplinarity; simulation and fictionality; and ethics. The course will be organized by three units: Space; Language; and History.",
