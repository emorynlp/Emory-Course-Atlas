    "class_notes": "Course Topic: Feminist Approaches to Archives and Race\n\n\nHow do structural forces of power impact the creation of archives? How does the creation of archives affect our ability, in the present, to do literary-historical work? What new approaches might we engage in order to overcome the scarcity--or absence altogether--of records that document the contributions of, for example, enslaved women, Latinx, American Indian, and other minoritized groups. This course will bring together core theories of the archive, developed over the past several decades, with recent feminist approaches to archival scholarship--particularly those that focus on issues of gender and race--in order to begin to answer these questions. We will contextualize these theories and approaches with a set of primary texts, drawn from literature of the Americas of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, that exemplify the need for such interventions.\n \nThe seminar will culminate in a final project of each participant's choosing, including but not limited to a bibliographic essay, an archival research project, a proposal for an archival research fellowship, or a review of a digital archive. All students will complete a final presentation in conference format about the chosen final project.",
