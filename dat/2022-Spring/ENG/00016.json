Through close reading and occasional film viewing, we will aim to make sense of a selection of English dramas written between the late fifteenth century and the early seventeenth century focusing on transgressive female characters and topics such as sexuality, race, reproduction, marriage, adultery, domestic violence, and revenge. Class work will emphasize close reading of these dramas within a variety of historical and cultural contexts and from a range of theoretical perspectives. Class expectations include active participation in discussion and regular writing, including research-based and multimodal assignments.",
