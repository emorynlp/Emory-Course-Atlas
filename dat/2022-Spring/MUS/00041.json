We will learn about the histories and contexts of sacred music-making such as gospel, spirituals, shape-note singing, and lined-out hymn singing, genres that were dynamic and popular expressions of agency and resistance across race class, gender, and geography in the nineteenth- and twentieth-century southern United States. We will also learn skills and methods related to digitization and the development of web-based digital libraries. Through a semester-long research and digital production project, student teams will draw on this knowledge to contribute to the Sounding Spirit digital library (https://soundingspirit.org), a new cutting-edge digital collection of important historic songbooks.",
