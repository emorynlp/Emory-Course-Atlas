They have been experienced, imagined and theorized locally and in cross-cultural transmissions, sometimes in mediated forms such as literary and graphic descriptions. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to these sonic phenomena, using comparative and transmedia approaches to address their multicultural repercussions, while giving equal attention to their socio-historic contexts. You will gain an overview of the diverse, complex, and ever-evolving Chinese soundscape, aided by methods of sound studies and literary/cultural criticism.\n\n\nMusic majors: fulfills a Category B course.",
