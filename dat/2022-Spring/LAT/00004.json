We will read at least one play in Latin (likely Terence's Andria/ Woman of Andros) along with some comparative material as well as other complete plays in translation.  Questions of staging and performance will also inform our reading of the texts.\nTexts: \nI hope we will use the almost final edition with student commentary of Terence's Andria by Prof. Sander Goldberg (to be published by Cambridge Press late 2022 or 2023).  If so, the department will provide printouts of this text to all enrolled students.\nI will recommend but not require that you use Goldberg's companion volume, published by Bloomsbury.  I suggest you not purchase this volume until we have met for the first few classes, however.\nParticulars:  Prerequisite:  Latin 202 or equivalent.  Two to three hourly examinations, a short research paper, and a final.\nThis course is a LINC (Learning Through Inclusive Collaboration) course with PSYC 111. Funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, LINC'd courses are designed to help faculty and students who are engaged in thematically related courses across different disciplines to create points of intersection, or links, between the two courses. Each course will remain independently taught, but will engage in several LINC activities that will draw connections across key themes and concepts and help students integrate across ways of knowing.",
