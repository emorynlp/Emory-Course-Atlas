The course will contextualize the religions in the larger frame of popular religious practices. We will also examine the patterns of interactions among these traditions in different historical periods. Our themes will include: the invisible world of gods and spirits, worldly benefits, religion and state, and the lives of shrines, temples, and monasteries. We will also discuss the religious life in contemporary East Asia under the impact of modernization and globalization.\nThroughout the learning process, students will not only get familiar with the major religious traditions in East Asia, but also increase awareness of the different perspectives in understanding the role of religions in ancient and modern society. They should also develop interpretative and critical skills in reading primary sources and secondary sources. The students will also discuss the important aspects of religious life and the interplay of religion and politics in East Asia.\n\n\n(Same as RE; 212 1)",
