What is the relationship between Zionism, good citizenship in America or in Europe and traditional Jewish religion? What are the special challenges facing Israeli Jewry? How has Jewish thought been influenced by the Holocaust, or by feminism? This class uses literary, historical, philosophical and anthropological material to explore these and other questions. We will focus on Jewish religious and intellectual life, but always try to relate these to the larger existential dilemmas that Jewish people have faced, and continue to face, in modern times.",
