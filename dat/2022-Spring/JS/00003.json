And yet, for all their separateness and severe criticism of modern life and mores, they are selectively integrated into the secular world, benefitting from many dimensions of modernity.  \nIn this course, we will examine who the Haredim are - their history, value system, social structure, and how they manage to balance tradition and modernity.  What motivates them?  How are they able to achieve success, and at what cost? How are men, women and children educated and socialized? How do they economically support themselves?  We will uncover the variety of Haredi communities in contemporary America and Israel, and take a look at those who've chosen to leave their families and communities and why.\n\n\n(Same as REL 190 1)",
