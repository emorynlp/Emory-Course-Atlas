    "class_notes": "The Gothic cathedral, that most characteristic of medieval creations, has been variously portrayed as a symbol of the Heavenly Jerusalem, a theater for the arts, the supreme example of structural engineering, the reflection of Scholastic ideals, and a visual `bible for the poor.' This course will explore all aspects of artistic endeavor on the Gothic site, from its stone vaulting sustained by flying buttresses and the elaborate carvings on the exterior, to the vibrant stained-glass windows illuminating the interior.  Scholarship on the economic and social implications of this kind of large-scale building places the cathedrals in a broader cultural context, as do recent restorations at Chartres and Notre-Dame of Paris that challenge us to look at these building with new eyes.",
    "course_description": "The cathedral is a symbol of the Heavenly Jerusalem, masterpiece of structural engineering, reflection of Scholastic ideals, visual Bible for the illiterate, and house of worship. This course will explore all these aspects in the earliest French monuments that gave birth to Gothic architecture.",
