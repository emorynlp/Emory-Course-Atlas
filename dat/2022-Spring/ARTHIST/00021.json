    "class_notes": "Computer graphics are an essential aspect of modern computation platforms. At the turn of the last century, it was required that engineers, architects, and designers have the common know-how to operate a graphics workstation in their respective workplaces. With the rapid progress of microprocessor technology, it became possible to produce three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics that can be manipulated in quasi real-time. This technology, which enabled interactions with three-dimensional virtual objects, immediately made its way into several different mainstream industry including design, visualization, and video gaming.\nThis course will introduce the concepts of 3D modeling, texturing, and visualization using real-time game engines such as UnityTM. For the first half of the course, we will go through hands-on assignments to learn and practice developing/modifying 3D assets. For the second half of the course, we will focus on real-time rendering game engines and its various applications. We shall learn (see demos) about various 3D visualization paradigms such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). This course will introduce the concepts of basic interactive programming via scripting using the C# programming language. We shall implement basic 3D asset manipulation using the scripting language mentioned above. Finally, we shall learn about various application (immersive) deployment strategies that real-time game engines have to offer.",
