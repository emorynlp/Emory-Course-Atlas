    "class_notes": "\"Cézanne, Matisse, Picasso\" \nThis course will focus on avant-garde art in Paris through the First World War, with a special focus on the highly influential work of Paul Cézanne, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso. Understanding the avant-garde will require intensive treatment of certain core problems, key works, exhibitions, ideas and shared themes. Our aim will be to understand the violent and seemingly irreversible shift in the nature of art-making we associate with Cézanne's last Bathers, Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon, Matisse's Bonheur de vivre, and so on. We will also address artists that inhabit the larger avant-garde of the moment including the work of Pierre Bonnard, Suzanne Valadon, and Félix Vallotton.\nArt History major/minor: Division III",
