    "class_notes": "\"Issues in Roman Portraiture\"        \nSince the Renaissance, portraiture  has been recognized as a signal achievement of ancient Roman art.  Representations of individuals at all levels of society, from slaves to emperors, were produced from the 3rd century B.C. to the sixth century A.C. and are often remarkable for their psychological penetration.  This seminar will explore current issues in Roman portrait studies with particular focus on how image and identity are constructed.  The seminar will also consider the historiography of Roman portraiture,  issues of collecting, display and restoration, current trends in iconographical methodologies, and the new implications for Roman portraiture within emerging developments in the digital humanities, including 3D photogrammetry digital modeling.",
