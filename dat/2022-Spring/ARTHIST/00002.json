    "class_notes": "\"From boy king to pop icon: The tomb of Tutankhamun across three millennia\"In 1922, British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered the near-intact tomb of the short-lived Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun (d. c. 1327 BCE). The widely publicized find propelled 'King Tut' to a modern worldwide celebrity status, and artefacts from the tomb remain among the most iconic works of ancient Egyptian art. This seminar explores the tomb of Tutankhamun from multiple perspectives, including the king's historical context in the aftermath of a failed religious revolution, the ritual importance of the tomb and its lavish contents, the 20th-century politics of the tomb's rediscovery, and its impact on modern perceptions of ancient Egyptian culture.\n\n\n(Freshmen Only)",
