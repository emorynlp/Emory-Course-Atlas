    "class_notes": "\"Ancient Egyptian religion at the Michael C. Carlos Museum\"The great majority of ancient Egyptian objects in museum collections were made and/or used for religious purposes. This course explores ancient Egyptian relations to gods, spirits, and the dead through objects in the Michael C. Carlos Museum, paying attention to the many ways materials, techniques and iconography were engaged with to make objects meaningful and efficacious in religious practices. Through individual student projects, the course also provides introductions to, and experience with, the practical sides of museum research, including the description and illustration of objects as well as finding and using parallels from other collections to inform interpretation.",
