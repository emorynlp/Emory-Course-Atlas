The course will extend into new areas of knowledge and decision support methods and systems by exploring \"big data\" concepts and approaches to systems that support these new architectures. Another critical area for decision-making is the visualization of data. Data visualization, data reporting, and active data manipulation approaches and tools will be explored. This will include advanced tools like GIS, OLTP, and visualization systems.",
