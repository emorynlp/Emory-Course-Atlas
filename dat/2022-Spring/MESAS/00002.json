It will examine the conventions and historical development of these writing systems as well as the process by which the alphabet came into being in Syro-Palestine and was adapted to write other languages in the ancient Mediterranean world such as Greek and Latin.  It introduces students to linguistic principles and strategies of decipherment, looks in some detail at the great decipherments of cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Minoan Linear B, and examines yet undeciphered scripts, including Linear A and the Voynych Manuscript.)",
