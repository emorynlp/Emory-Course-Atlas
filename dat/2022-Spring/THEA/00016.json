We will read plays, compose analytical essays, and render theater based creative projects within the context of Asian and Asian American history. Some key questions this course will engage in are: Historically, how have Asian Americans been represented on American stages? What known and lesser known historical contexts have created Asian American stereotypes and lead to the marginalization of Asian American narratives in the dramatic cannon? How are playwrights of the 20th and 21st century redefining Asian American drama and identity and what does \"Asian American Identity\" actually mean?",
