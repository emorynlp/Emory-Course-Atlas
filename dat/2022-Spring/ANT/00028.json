How does Catholicism understand IVF or Judaism understand human cloning? Who are the parents of children born from egg or sperm donation under different forms of Islam in different parts of the world? How should a modern, religiously pluralistic society address controversial bioethical issues related to abortion? Why are \"sacred bioethics\" a necessary ingredient in today's bioethics debates?
