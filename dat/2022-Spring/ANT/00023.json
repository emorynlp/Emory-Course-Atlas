We will examine various political, economic, and ideological projects including colonialism, capitalism, and international humanitarianism to examine the ways in which they reflect and produce an unequal world. In each case, we will consider the gendered and racialized logics embedded within these projects as well as the cultural formations that they create. While the course has a broad geographic scope, we will pay particular attention to global processes that intersect with the African continent.",
