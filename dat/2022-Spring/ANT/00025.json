The scale of this phenomenon leaves little untouched: from the foods that we eat, to the buildings we pass through daily, to the electronic devices that we rely on, to refugees' pursuit of safe havens, or to medical practices that we now take for granted. In practice, the distinction between freedom and unfreedom is not always clear-cut. Technologies initially developed to control the labor, reproductive ability, or even dead bodies of individuals subjected to unfree labor gradually seeped into fields and among individuals who are, according to the law, free from slavery.\nThis course will explore three questions: 1) Why has human bondage been so persistent in spite of, by now, its universal condemnation? 2) How do states and international organizations distinguish between victims of human trafficking and other kinds of migrants, and what are the political repercussions that such distinctions have? 3) How have technologies developed to control populations subjected to slavery and human trafficking been expanded into new realms of the economy and to whose advantage?",
    "course_description": "The course explores human trafficking from the era of the trans- Atlantic slave trade to present-day instances of trafficking in productive and reproductive labor. Through primary and secondary sources, the students learn about the racial and gender ideologies undergirding this phenomenon.",
