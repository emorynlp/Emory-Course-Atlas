We will examine how ethnographic writing positions the queer and/or feminist subject within its texts in relation to the world, and to its readership. Our starting point will be to ask how ethnographies locate and challenge gender, sexuality, race, and power. We will specifically interrogate how queer and feminist ethnographies have sought to engage what it means to be human through their attention these categories. We approach each text tracing the material, ideological, emotional, and psychic modalities through which gender, sexuality, race and power are produced. Students will also delve into questions of ethnography as craft, and the ways in which form might come to reflect queer and feminist subjects and epistemologies. We will explore tensions and resonances between queer and feminist approaches, while we discuss and experiment with what it means to make theory through ethnography. Readings are clustered around shared themes and topics, such as abolition, violence, girlhood, pregnancy, legal subjectivity, and kinship. Texts are drawn from a range of historical and geographic localities to allow us to work through what it means to think transnationally and across disciplines.",
