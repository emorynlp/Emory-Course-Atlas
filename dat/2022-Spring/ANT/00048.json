    "class_notes": "The relatively new field of Ancient DNA has proved transformative in the understanding of evolution in humans and other species. By accessing the genetic martial of a population from known archeological contexts, we are now capable of examining evolution in both space and time. In this course, we will focus on both the key methods adopted in the study of ancient DNA, such as next generation sequencing and population genetics, as well as a thematic approach to the major evolutionary questions broached thus far. Topics include human migrations, archaic humans, plant and animal domestication, ancient pathogens, the origins of auto-immune disorders, and adaptations to ancient environments.",
