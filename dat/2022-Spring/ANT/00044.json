    "class_notes": "This graduate seminar focuses on theories and practices that shift and challenge conventional Western modes of intellectual production and research, and that support liberatory, collaborative, and non-violent modes of knowledge exploration and production. Drawing on contemporary interdisciplinary scholarship as well as critiques within anthropology, we will move toward an \"anthropology otherwise.\" We will consider how structures of inequality, imperialism, and settler mentalities are embedded within certain academic knowledge practices, and we will engage work that provides direction for liberatory and transgressive forms of research and scholarship. Themes such as anti-oppression, self-determination, sovereignty, positionality, intent, responsibility, ethics, and voice -- as well as questions about research dissemination, legibility, and accessibility - figure centrally in this work.\n\n\nDuring the semester, seminar participants will share and develop their own research projects, and will engage with other practitioners, including guest lecturers.  Concrete skills and examples of research methods, modes of collaboration and accountability, and types of research output (e.g. writing and multi-modal forms) will be covered as we support seminar participants. Readings under consideration include work by Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Faye V. Harrison, Trinh Minh-ha, Zoe Todd, Vine Deloria, J. K'haulani Kauanui, Ryan Cecil Jobson, Chela Sandoval, and E. Gabriel Dattatreyan.  During the first few weeks, the class will work together to determine the schedule, the material to be produced, and the evaluation criteria.  A collaborative contract will be established for the course guidelines and expectations.  This will be written up and posted on Canvas.",
