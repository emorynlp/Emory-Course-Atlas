    "class_notes": "Anthropologists have long claimed ethnography as central to the identity of their discipline. But what is it? In this course, we will explore different ways that anthropologists have worked as ethnographers and, drawing on selected case studies, we will examine the key elements that constitute their research practice. At the same time, we will look at how ethnographically generated insights are organized into particular kinds of textual and filmic narratives. Students will learn to critically analyze ethnographic texts and films, attending to content, approach and style. Additionally, they will develop writing skills through a series of exercises that combine description with analysis.",
