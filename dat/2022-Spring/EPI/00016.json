Molecular epidemiology encompasses topics beyond the recent era of \"-omics.\" Biospecimens have been analyzed to evaluate exposures and health states for decades. We will cover applications of molecular epidemiology used to protect or improve public health, including biospecimen collection, assay techniques, and disease biomarkers. Topics will include: (a) cholesterol in heart disease, (b) methods of infectious disease surveillance (COVID-19, mosquito-borne diseases), and (c) molecular aspects of the opioid crisis.",
