Topics will include Davis's involvement in the Black Power and Black Panther movements of the 1960 and 70s, Black feminism, the anti-prison movement, Black Lives Matter, and transnational liberation struggles around the world. We will also explore her writings in relation to their historical and philosophical underpinnings, including Marx, Marcuse, Frederick Douglass, Huey Newton, and others. The course will reflect on how Davis's work offers a powerful lens for framing contemporary struggles around sexism, antiblack violence, colonialism, the effects of our climate crisis, and other pressing issues of our time. Students will be encouraged to draw on Davis's writings as well as materials related to her very public life to think about their own academic and political commitments. Assessment will include weekly Instagram posts (20%), a short midterm paper (30%), and a final project (50%).",
