In doing so, the course examines what scholar, Frank Wilderson, has described as the gratuitous nature of anti-black violence and the political ontology of black social death. With these topics (as just a few examples) in mind, the course specifically interrogates aesthetics as a field of representation whence blackness and anti-blackness might be a specter to the borders and frames of its field. The course also draws on psychoanalytic, feminist, and literary theories as a way to approach the artistic works under examination. Bearing questions on the political and ethical brought into sharp focus by Afro-pessimism alongside continental and popular understandings of aesthetics, the course, in turn, attempts to think about the strictures that \"aesthetics\" and \"representation\" as concepts might pose in themselves; thus, asking: what might be the political consequences and implications when aesthetics cannot fully grasp or grapple with blackness and anti-blackness in the orders of politics, technologies, representation, or senses and sensibilities.",
