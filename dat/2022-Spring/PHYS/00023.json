    "course_description": "This course provides students with the basic physics necessary to describe continuous media such as fluids and solids. It is an introductory course intended for graduate students as well as upper-level undergraduate students. Students will learn how to apply Newtonian mechanics and conservation laws to deformable systems which can bend, stretch, and flow. Topics include hydrostatics, buoyancy, surface tension, elastostatics, buckling, stress and strain tensors, Navier-Stokes equations, incompressible flow, viscosity and viscous flow, elastic vibrations, and dimensionless numbers. The course will also include selected special topics such as turbulence, seismology, jumps and shocks, instabilities and linear stability analysis, vorticies, boundary layers, and convection.",
