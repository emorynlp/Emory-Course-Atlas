The first part of the course will address the expansion of rights and liberties in the Constitution following the Civil War. Initially, the Court interpreted the Post-War Amendments as prohibiting racial oppression exclusively. Accordingly, the course will examine the historical development of Court doctrine related to race and examine contemporary debates.",
