We will analyze Supreme Court precedent governing pre-trial liberty and wealth-based detention and will discuss the ways in which those precedents play out in real-world courts. Students will examine the roles of criminal legal system actors (judges, police, prosecutors, defense counsel, and private companies) in shaping how a person's financial status affects his experience in the criminal legal system.",
