    "course_description": "The First Year Colloquy II is virtually identical to DM701: it too is a weekly synchronous gathering, held Monday afternoons at 3:00 p.m., in which students explore with each other and with faculty of the course taught during that semester their coursework in relation to (1) their context of ministry and (2) their research trajectory. DM702 includes additional work on the Statement of the Problem document, in which students offer their first articulation of the issue(s) they will address in their final project and how they will go about doing so. The latter is assessed by the director of the DMin program.",
