Through close reading/viewing of various kinds of texts (chronicles, treaties and other government documents, fiction, poetry, music, visual arts, oral histories, and film), students will gain a critical understanding of the ideological, political and cultural constructions of la frontera as experienced in the U.S. borderlands and in \"border spaces\" in Atlanta. As circumstances allow, the class will explore specific places in Atlanta in person. We will also explore multiple ways of gathering evidence, including an experiential component in which we will engage texts through other arts forms in order to more closely observe the texts and our own expressions of borders and border experiences. Some of these sessions will be created and led by students after working with the professor.",
