    "class_notes": "Life is always `en obras' --that is, `under construction.' The focus of this course will be the relationship between life and learning as reflected in a wide range of texts ('obras') about/by young adults -- novels, short stories, epistolary writing, essays, journalistic writing, film - across a broad chronological and geographic spectrum. Close reading and discussion of these texts will provide an opportunity for students to reflect on their own experiences through their liberal arts education at Emory and their course work in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. Topics will include the Hispanic Bildungsroman, or coming of age novel; the global traveler; family, love and friendship; vocations and careers; material and spiritual riches; difference; success and failure. Because SPAN 318 is a foundational course designed to combine advanced writing instruction with the study of Hispanic cultural topics, weekly short analytical writing exercises will provide sustained practice in developing an argument based on research and evidence and will also allow students to develop their writing skills in ways that will serve them in the future as they tell their story and advocate for what matters.\nTEXTS: TBA\nPARTICULARS: Evaluation is based on active class participation, oral presentations, and a range of writing assignments of varying length.\nPREREQUISITES: SPAN 212 or equivalent placement",
