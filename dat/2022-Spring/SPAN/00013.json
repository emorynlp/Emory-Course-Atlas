It explores how sounds are produced (articulatory phonetics), how they are organized in Spanish  (phonology), and how these compare and contrast with typical pronunciations of English. The course also considers how speakers use the sounds of Spanish to perform and interpret regional/social identities and roles in communitive interactions within Spanish-speaking communities of Latin America, the US, and Spain.   \nTEXT: Readings provided by instructor. \nPARTICULARS: This course is designed for a wide variety of students, including those for whom Spanish is a primary or heritage language as well as for those who are learning Spanish as a second language.
