    "course_description": "In the last few decades, the business world has been engulfed in what Shumpeter aptly called the \"gales of creative destruction.\" Rates of new product development - where innovation has historically resided - have accelerated and changed with the advent of new approaches like Open Innovation. And Open Innovation itself has been enabled by new technology platforms. But technology has played an even more disruptive role in undergirding the development of radical new business models that are reshaping entire industries, such as Uber in Automotive and AirBnB in hospitality.\nIncumbent companies are right to wonder what they can do to prevent their becoming \"Amazoned.\" In this course, we will learn and apply a comprehensive framework that large corporations can use to effectively manage innovation. This framework can be critical to companies' resilience and continued success within a rapidly changing and often threatening market environment of profound technological and business model innovation.",
