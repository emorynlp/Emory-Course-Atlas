    "course_description": "This course focuses on building corporate advantage -- the problem of how multi-business firms can create value. Accordingly, we first explore sources of complementarities or synergy among businesses and how to manage them. We then examine how firms acquire new capabilities with a special emphasis on M&A, alliances, and internal development. Finally, we examine strategy analysis and formulation in uncertain and turbulent environments. This course may be useful for those who seek careers in consulting, general management, and investment banking where multi-business firms play an especially critical role.",
