In some sense, our work can define us, such that our economic opportunities, quests for fulfillment, and general happiness are heavily affected by what happens at work. Although many life outcomes are determined by workplace experiences, many employees face workplace disadvantages based on their demographic group membership. In this course, we will explore the ways in which race, and to a lesser extent, gender and class, shape economic opportunity and general well-being at work. Further, we will learn how organizations and employees attempt to manage bias and discrimination in organizations. Finally, we will explore tactics students can use to disrupt bias in the workplace.",
