In this course we will ask ourselves: what does it mean to \"own\" these items, who has the right to control them, and what are the ethical challenges of how they are displayed (or not)?  This course will use the institution of the museum - its history, collections, and possible futures - as a lens to explore how cultural artifacts and their preservation fit into understandings of history, memory, and the narratives of cultures and people, including those who have been marginalized or whose stories have been appropriated by others.\nConveners:\nMegan O'Neil, Art History and Faculty Curator, Michael C.
