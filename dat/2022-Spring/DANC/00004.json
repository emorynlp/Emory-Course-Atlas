But, in reality, both share the same building blocks dynamics, time and space. This course bridges the left and right side of the brain through rigor and creativity.  You will experience mathematics in a new way by exploring the relationship between movement concepts and math concepts. This is done via movement improvisations, discussions, presentations, and collaborative projects. This approach will help you overcome difficulties experienced in the past so that you can develop an in-depth understanding of simple and advanced mathematics, while building confidence in both math and dance. (no dance experience is necessary)",
