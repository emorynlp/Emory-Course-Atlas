This course explores several of the mechanisms by which humans are influencing the physical, chemical, and ecological conditions on the planet, and some of the potential consequences of those ongoing changes in systems for human societies. Although all topics presented in this course are intersectional, the impacts can be broadly grouped into planetary health impacts of ecosystem changes ('biosphere'), and planetary health impacts of geological and atmospheric changes ('geosphere'). Successful completion of this course will refine skills in systems thinking and regard for planetary challenges.",
