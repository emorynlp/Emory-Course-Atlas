    "class_notes": "Via the political lens of interests, institutions, and power, this course examines why and how certain public health interventions succeed (or fail) in getting proposed, adopted, and/or implemented.  We will review various 'stakeholder' groups and how they (attempt to) make their voices heard and why certain public health measures are inherently more challenging than others and how such challenges interact with local contexts. Using case studies, this course goes beyond courses on environmental justice, the social determinants of heath, implementation science, and/or health policy design by focusing on puzzles whose answers are heavily a function of political factors.",
