Topics will include neurogenesis, migration of neuronal precursors, axon guidance, programmed cell death, and the formation of synaptic connections.  Through study of primary literature and texts, students will develop skills in identifying hypotheses and analyzing the logic of the experiments used to test these hypotheses.  Prerequisites:  Biology 142 and Biology 142L.  This course originates in the Biology Department and may be taken as elective credit for the biology major.",
