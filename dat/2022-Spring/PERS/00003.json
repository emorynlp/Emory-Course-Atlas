Students write weekly response papers conveying their impressions or ideas about the subjects and material read/ listened.  Their writing is read and discussed in class (helping to learn through the successes/errors of others), and they are then asked to rewrite and expand their essays with attention to style, grammar and vocabulary.  These exercises help them to better comprehend the different kinds of written and oral texts, and to learn the skill of writing proficiently in Persian.",
