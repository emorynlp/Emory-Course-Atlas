In surveying the field, it will introduce students to various interpretive theories--many of which originate outside the discipline of history--that are now regularly employed in the analysis of historical texts and discourses. Emphasis will be placed on using cultural approaches to understand how social relations in the United States from the colonial era to the present have been informed by racial, ethnic, gender, and class identities. Among the cultural arenas we will explore and interpret in depth are print culture, mass or 'popular' culture, consumer culture, religious culture, cultural hierarchy, landscapes, and the built environment. Although the course focuses on U.S. history, students interested in other world regions will find many of its theoretical and methodological insights applicable to their fields of study.",
