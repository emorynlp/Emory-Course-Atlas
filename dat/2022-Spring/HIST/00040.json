This course will provide a history of the intimate and sometimes violent relations between the United States and its southern neighbors since the collapse of European empires more than two centuries ago. The course takes a broadly global and political-economic approach. Rather than depicting US-Latin American relations in a void, we will study how continental relations emerged within the broad global transformations of the first and second eras of global revolution (approx. 1765-1824 and 1947-1975), the world wars and the rise of global capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The course will pay particular attention to the questions of how, when and if the United States exercised imperial power on the continent.",
