Its technology was cutting edge, its cities prosperous, and its culture glorious. Four centuries later, it was being torn apart by foreign invaders as its citizens argued ineffectually. What had gone wrong? What could be done to revive and restore China? This course provides an introductory survey of the history of China, from the Ming dynasty (1368 - 1644) to today. It approaches Chinese history from a global perspective, with attention to how China's people interacted with a rapidly changing world. Today, after a century of revolution, China appears at last to have met the challenges of modernity, but what unfinished projects remain?\nFinal grades will be determined as follows: \nParticipation\t20% \nNews Presentation 20%\nMidterm Examination\t20%\nFinal Examination 20%\nPaper 20%",
