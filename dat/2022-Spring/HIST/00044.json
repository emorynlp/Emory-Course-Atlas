Centering the practices of storytelling and listening, we will approach oral history as a humanistic method of discovery. Students will investigate the intellectual foundations of oral history and how living memory and storytelling help to understand a phenomenon or experience. We will deconstruct oral history as a method of information gathering, including the ethics and practices required to plan, conduct, record, and transcribe oral interviews. Taking up a variety of themes, such as culture, identity, individual and collective remembering, to name a few, we will together explore how oral history offers a distinct and crucial approach to understanding the past, while developing skills for future research and professional pursuits.",
