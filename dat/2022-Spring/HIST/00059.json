Fuentes asks how scholars can \"narrate fleeting glimpses of enslaved subjects in the archives and meet the disciplinary demands of history that require us to construct unbiased accounts from these very documents?\" Fuentes's question is at the heart of \"U.S. Slavery and the Archive,\" a seminar that centers on the history of enslaved people as well as the methodological and archival problems that scholars encounter when attempting to historicize them. Throughout the semester, we will develop the research, critical thinking, and written and oral communication skills necessary to produce an original research paper.",
