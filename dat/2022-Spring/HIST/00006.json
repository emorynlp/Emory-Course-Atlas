Focusing around both case studies and general themes, drawing on a variety of materials (encompassing fiction, autobiographies, secondary texts, images, and films) as well as vigorous class discussion, the course will explore both what happened and why the story unfolded as it did. Questions addressed include: How has the basic meaning of health, illness, and medical caregiving changed over time? Who were the caregivers (and why did physicians gain preeminence)? Which constituencies have benefitted from American doctors and doctoring and which have not? The latter portions of the course will give particular attention to issues shaping American medicine today, while striving to understand current issues as part of ongoing historical processes. \nAssessments will be based on thoughtful engagement in weekly discussions and two written assignments of approximately ten pages each.",
