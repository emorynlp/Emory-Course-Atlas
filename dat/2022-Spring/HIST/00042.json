Weekly readings will move us chronologically from the nineteenth through twenty-first centuries, and will highlight how race, ethnicity, legal status, gender, and class intersect with our class themes. We will learn how migrants have been constructed as subjects historically, discuss borders as projects of nation-building, and engage questions about transnational communities as everyday lived realities and responses to a bordered world. The course takes a migrant-centered approach to the study of human mobility and the structures that aim to limit, control, and place it under surveillance. Scholarly readings will be paired with primary materials - including testimonios, music, art - that depict migrant narratives to help us collectively conceptualize migration to/within the US historically and in our current moment.",
