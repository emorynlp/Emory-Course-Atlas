Scholars speak of democracy in the home, classroom, public spaces, streets, parks and public transport. Of a sensibility and culture, and a continuous negotiation of interests and conflicts among different parties, individuals, communities, nations. We explore this wider sense of democracy in the present seminar. \nWeekly classes will engage closely with major texts on the idea and practice of democracy in North America and Western Europe, South Asia, Latin America and other parts of the world in which members of the seminar have research interests. Texts for discussion will include writings by Peter Linebaugh, Uday Mehta, Denise Da Silva on the foundations of modern democracy; Du Bois, Ta-nehisi Coates, Gloria Anzaldua and Carol Anderson on the USA; Rolph Trouillot, Fr. Gustavo Guti√©rrez and June Nash on Latin America; and B. R. Ambedkar, Partha Chatterjee and Madhav Khosla on South Asia.",
