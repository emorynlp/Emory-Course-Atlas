    "class_notes": "This graduate seminar focuses on three irreducibly inter-related topics in political philosophy:  equality and inequality(understood both in economic terms but also in larger cultural senses); meritocracy and dessert(in the context of individuals but also multiple kinds of social groups); and, democracy and authoritarianism(understood both as political but also larger cultural formations). Following an initial examination of notions of equality and inequality in ancient, modern, and more contemporary thought, the seminar will explore the origins and meanings of merit and meritocracy by focusing on recent critical analyses.  This will lead to study of the relations between democracy, authoritarianism, and merit and possibilities for democracy to avoid or overcome criticisms of meritocracy.  Finally, this will lead back to notions of equality and to new ways of understanding the nature and value of equal opportunity as well as policy implications of these understandings.",
