Nouvet / Fridays 1:00-4:00pm (in person) / cross-listed with PHIL 789\nContent:  In The Differend, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard sets up a task for philosophical thought: to bear witness to the differend. But what is a \"differend\" and how does it signal itself? As we explore these questions, we will read some of Lyotard's earlier writings in which a sensitivity to differends was already at work. We will then turn to his later writings and focus on:\n 1) the differend  between what he calls the \"affect-phrase\" and articulation \n 2) his reassessment of the postmodern condition in texts such as Postmodern Fables.\nThe course will be taught in English. One final paper and one oral presentation.\nTexts may include:\nLyotard: The Differend ( University of Minnesota Press) (selections)\n                Postmodern Fables ( University of Minnesota Press) (selections)\n    Political Writings  (University Of Minnesota Press) (selections)\n   \"The Affect-phrase\" \n   \"Emma\" The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge (University Of Minnesota Press)       (selections)",
