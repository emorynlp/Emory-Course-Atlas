    "class_notes": "Logic is the study of argumentation and correct reasoning. Logicians ask questions like: What makes for a good or bad argument? Can we codify the rules of legitimate argumentation? What are common traps and tropes of reasoning? While these questions may seem abstract and academic, this class will focus around being reflective about how we tend to reason in our everyday lives and how we can start to reason better. Beginning from elementary investigations into the basics of argumentation, we will construct a foundation for understanding the intricacies of formal logic. While understanding such material will not enable you to win every argument, it will allow you to make your commitments and your reasoning clear.",
