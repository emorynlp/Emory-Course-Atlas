The course takes up critical theories on the topics of anti-blackness, law, and violence to bring into question what shapes political, theological, and ontological bearings of the human, rights, and judgment. The question of political judgment and myth in and against relations of blackness will allow us as a class to think alongside (and often depart from) philosophers of the continental tradition such as Walter Benjamin's \"Critique of Violence\" and Louis Althusser's \"legal ideology\" in order to interrogate concepts such as riot, custody, and policing.",
