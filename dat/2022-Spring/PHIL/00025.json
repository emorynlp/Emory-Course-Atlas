Can sexuality provide the resources to answer the question \"who am I\"  \"Does blackness problematize the relation between sexuality, identity, and being? Is \"queerness\" a generative analytic for blackness or a conceptual impasse? Our aim in this seminar is to understand the architecture of black sexuality - gender, sex, sexual difference, and identity. The seminar will investigate the interstitial relation between blackness and sexuality - understanding sexuality as a matrix of violence and, also, a field of self-fashioning. The readings are primarily theoretical/philosophical, including texts by Hortense Spillers, Saidiya Hartman, Tommy Curry, Denise Ferreira da Silva, Jennifer Nash, Marquis Bey, among others.",
