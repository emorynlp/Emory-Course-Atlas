    "class_notes": "The course explores some of the founding texts and contexts of `Black Hegelianism.' After considering works by Sartre, Fanon, Kojeve, et al, we will go on to explore how those texts have led to a new questioning of the meaning of 'blackness' itself. In relation to which we will reconsider such questions as: \"What is Blackness?\" and \"Why is the `is' of Blackness always in question, or never simply present in its questioning?\" It is in the context of such questions that we will then be able to ask: \"What is blackness for Hegel? And why is it something that occurs by chance, as though from an encounter with something beyond the subject, something that is exorbitant and yet wholly gratuitous?\" \nAll students are expected to make semi-formal presentations to the class, and to participate actively in discussion.",
