Proceeding more or less chronologically, we will touch on a variety of topics, such as: medium specificity and the debate between formalist and realist camps; the semiotic, textual, and psychoanalytic \"turns\" that marked the field during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s; issues of representation and counter cinemas; philosophical approaches to film; and the impact of digital technologies relative to photographic indexicality as well as the futures of cinema and its academic study. Authors we'll encounter include: Béla Balázs, Germaine Dulac, Sergei Eisenstein, Walter Benjamin, Siegfried Kracauer, André Bazin, Christian Metz, Laura Mulvey, Jean-Louis Comolli, Julio García Espinosa, Mary Ann Doane, Kaja Silverman, D.N. Rodowick, Jacques Derrida, and Jean-Luc Nancy, among numerous others. Class sessions will be supplemented by weekly film screenings in a traditional, collective (i.e. theatrical) setting.\n\n\nDesigned for those with and without a background in film studies, the seminar provides students the opportunity to engage some of the key themes/figures populating film theory, while setting the stage for further research in the field.",
