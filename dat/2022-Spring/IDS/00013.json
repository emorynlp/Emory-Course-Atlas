In the course 'Learning Italian through Gamification,' students will apply the building blocks of games (such as goals, rules, and point systems) to the process of teaching and learning a foreign language. In this project-based course, Computer Science students and Italian as a Second Language students will team up, design, and develop educational games to support teaching and learning of Italian Arts and Literature topics.",
