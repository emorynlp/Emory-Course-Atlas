The course will cover topics such as race relations, suburbanization, urban renewal, housing, transportation, immigrant communities, gentrification, and the city's art and music scene. Secondary readings will expose you to existing scholarship about the city and allow you to contextualize and understand Atlanta within the broader field of urban history. Field trips will be an integral part of the course and allow you to experience the city first-hand. In addition, the use of primary sources such as photography, film, speeches, maps, and music will allow us to analyze the myriad forces that shaped and continue to shape Atlanta's history and culture. The final project for the course will involve independent, interdisciplinary research and the creation of a piece of public scholarship.",
