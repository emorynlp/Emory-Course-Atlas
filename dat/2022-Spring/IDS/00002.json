We will examine what people think about, tell about and remember about the college experience, through both contemporary and historical accounts.   Through our exploration of novels and short stories, film, and television shows, we will discuss themes such as gender, race, class, and the popular picture of colleges and universities in America.  How has college life changed over the decades? What has been most important to writers and directors as they create the fictional college experience? How do the images of college presented in these texts compare to our own understanding of life at the university? Through reading and watching fictional accounts, we will try to determine how these texts influence decision-making about higher education, on both a personal and political level.",
