CONTACT PWAKEFI@EMORY.EDU FOR PERMISSION; INDICATE WHICH IDS COURSE CARRYING THE ENGRD CO-REQ YOU WISH TO REGISTER FOR. \nIDS 200W examines the origins of distinct disciplines in contemporary universities through the lens of evidence in different fields of human knowledge. Recommended for students at any level interested in health sciences, law, business, or future studies at the graduate level. IDS 200 introduces students to the Liberal Arts and support student's studies in a wide range of majors. Systematic focus on writing essential in any career. Students enroll in co-requisite ENGRD 223, one credit, S/U, in the same semester as IDS 200 (if you took ENGRD 223 previously, the co-requisite is fulfilled.) Grounded in the humanities, IDS 200 examines the development of distinct disciplines in contemporary universities through the lens of what counts as evidence in different fields of human knowledge. In the ancient tragedy Antigone, for example, a young woman defies the law for love of her brother. But could the young woman's love, her thinking, speech patterns, and motivations be due to genetic dispositions, neural mechanisms, religious extremism, or mental disease? Such questions highlight the problematic nature of evidence and explanation that we will examine. Short writing assignments; midterm proposal/essay; final 5000-word research paper; participation in class discussion, and co-requisite ENGRD 223 Rhetorical Grammar.",
