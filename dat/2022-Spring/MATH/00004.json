    "class_notes": "Course Description: In this course we will explore topics in mathematics related to fairness. The first topic is the Apportionment Problem:  how to fairly allocate a number of equally valuable resources to entities of varying sizes.   The most famous application of apportionment is in the context of fairly assigning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives to the individual states.   The second topic we will study is Fair Division:  the problem of dividing resources of varying worth among several equally deserving people so that each person believes they received a fair share.  Time permitting, other mathematical topics related to fairness will be discussed.",
