May be repeated for credit when the topic varies.\nPublic policy and public opinion are a major focus of this course. With the rollout of low cost smartphones in 2015, India is moving closer to what will likely be the world's most diverse laboratory for studying media-driven campaigns of all types -- political, public health, NGO and corporate. We will discuss timely topics such as climate change and disaster preparedness; public health; public diplomacy and foreign policy; regional conflict and security; CSR and national development; and political campaigning and party strategies in the 2019 election campaign. With the country's large demographic dividend, India is estimated to become the largest economy in the world over the two next decades. Yet India must address many environmental and economic challenges, and the country needs to innovate at a faster pace. The course will address how India is addressing the dual challenges of innovation and sustainability.\nThis class can also be used as an elective towards the MESAS major or MESAS minor.",
