This seminar will introduce students to major theoretical perspectives, debates, controversies, and research findings in the empirical study of gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and politics primarily, but not exclusively,  in the United States. We will study gender and race (and, to a lesser extent, sexuality and ethnicity) not only as identities but also as political constructs or ideologies and as systems of stratification and power that shape political institutions, processes, and outcomes. In addition, we will examine how these aspects of gender and race affect the political behavior and experiences of individuals as citizens, workers, voters, political activists, community leaders, political candidates, and public officials.",
