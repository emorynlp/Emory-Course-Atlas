We will use models; primarily game theoretic models, to examine how actors make decisions when confronting friends or foes, under constraints, and in environments filled with uncertainty. This class will be an introduction to one way of thinking about international relations, which emphasizes constructing logical (often mathematical) frameworks to answer questions like: Why do wars start and end? How do states trade? When does globalization affect development? There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, this class will involve analysis of logical statements and systems, and comfort with mathematical reasoning will be very helpful.",
