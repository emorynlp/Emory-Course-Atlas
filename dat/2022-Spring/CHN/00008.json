With Western-style fast food, sugary drinks, milk, and factory-farmed beef and pork, critics charge that dietary Westernization of the Chinese diet has led to increased rates of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, not to mention environmental degradation, loss of connection to culinary traditions, and even our recent covid-19 crisis. Is any of this true? This course will tackle dietary Westernization from an interdisciplinary perspective and consider the implications for health, environment, and national identity.",
