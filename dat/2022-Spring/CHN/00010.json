In this course we will explore the rich novella traditions as they developed in Italy and China, roughly from the 13th to the 17th centuries. We will focus on four broad categories (literature, society, ethics, and love) that will allow us to explore points of similarities and divergence between the two traditions, including shifting conceptions of literature, authorship, and readership, the interplay between classical and vernacular culture, the ways in which ethical norms, religious beliefs, gender ideals and conceptions of society shape and are shaped through these stories.",
