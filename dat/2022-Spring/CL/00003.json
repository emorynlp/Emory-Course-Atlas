    "class_notes": "The Romans' is a literature-based survey course of ancient Rome: it investigates Roman history, culture, and society from its origins through the late empire through intensive focus upon its primary literary texts. As such, it is not a history course, but brings the interests and intrigue of this world power to light via its own rich literary tradition, paying close attention to what gives these works of literature such enduring appeal and influence. It is suitable for both non-majors and majors with interests in Classical Civilization, History, Literature, and Latin; all texts will be (closely! obsessively!) read and analyzed from English translations.",
