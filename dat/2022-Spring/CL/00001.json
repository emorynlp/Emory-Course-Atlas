In the modern world they have served as perennial topics for films and popular media, from Harryhausen's Argonauts (1963) to Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Myths are powerful things for the mortals who tell them, and help create social solutions to real-world problems. In this course we will explore the stories themselves, the ancient materials which help us recover these tales, and the contexts, cultural, geographic, and historical - in which they are told, both ancient and modern. We will gain an understanding of myth `on the ground' - more than literature, more than art, deeply practical and fundamentally human.",
