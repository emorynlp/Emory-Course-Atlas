We live in an increasingly noisy world and becoming a compelling storyteller is your best chance to break through. The course will explore how we make ideas sticky using examples ranging from Hollywood scripts to brands with cult like status (Peloton). Once we build a foundation for becoming effective communicators, we'll examine the creator economy that is fueling the biggest digital platforms of the day (FB, IG, TikTok, Email, Podcasts).",
