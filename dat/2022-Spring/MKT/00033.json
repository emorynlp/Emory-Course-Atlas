    "course_description": "The purpose of this course is two-fold. The primary purpose is to generate awareness and appreciation of the way several substantive topics in marketing have been studied empirically using quantitative models. This seminar reviews empirical models of marketing phenomena including consumer choice, adoption of new products, sales response to marketing mix elements, and competitive interaction. A secondary goal for this course is to provide students with a background in the analysis of data for problems that occur in marketing. By the end of the course, students should be familiar with the key issues and approaches in empirical marketing modeling. Students should be prepared to read and understand the literature in a manner that will stimulate new research interest",
