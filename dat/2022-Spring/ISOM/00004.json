    "course_description": "Introduces the fundamentals of coding, programming and systems design thinking. Steve Jobs said \"Everyone should learn how to code, because it teaches you how to think.\" The course is designed for folks with low-to-no coding background and exposes one to the tools that support other decision making activities. We develop basic skills in Python (data manipulation, string handling, etc) and in web development - HTML/CSS/js (web design) and some will be involved in Java language. In addition, concepts and languages in 3D Printing, augmented reality and game design are explored. Many small projects and a few summary projects are used to demonstrate acquired skills.",
