    "course_description": "Second-year MDiv students who are not in the Teaching Parish Program choose an ecclesial setting that shares a life of worship as well as ministry. The student's work in the ecclesial setting is supervised by a site mentor. Students meet in reflection groups each semester. These groups inquire into the history, meaning, and execution of the practices of an ecclesial community. Students remain in the same placement and small group for two semesters. An evaluation is made at the end of each semester, and an IP (in progress) grade is assigned at the end of the first semester if the student is performing satisfactorily. To receive credit, the student must satisfactorily complete two consecutive semesters.",
