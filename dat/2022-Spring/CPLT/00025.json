The objective is to try out a different narrative, where ecocriticism is not necessarily a nostalgic return to the world after decades of formalism and myopia literary and visual studies, but a militant turn to description and the arts of describing that could find its impetus in the work of Svetlana Alpers, Louis Marin, Roland Barthes, Norman Bryson, Daniel Arasse, Jacques Ranci√®re, Paul de Man, Victor Stoichita, and Eve Sedgwick among others.
