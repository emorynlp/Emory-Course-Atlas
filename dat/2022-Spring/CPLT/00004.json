    "class_notes": "\"Americas Queer: North and South\" | How can \"queerness\" be understood in a pan-American framework? Do the Americas have a common \"queerness\"? And if not, what changes in terms of the definitions, practices, inflections are incidental to the term and which render the term into a constitutively different one? Can we talk on the one hand, about queerness as practice versus queerness as identity? \nThe course moves in a general historical framework, as we examine different moments of what can perhaps be understood as a common history. The course starts in the 1880s, with Oscar Wilde's celebrity tour of the United States, at the height of his popularity when, as a member of the audience, the Cuban patriot and revolutionary Jose Marti wrote an account of what he saw that was reprinted all over Latin America.
