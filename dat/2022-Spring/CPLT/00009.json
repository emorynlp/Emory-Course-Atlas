    "class_notes": "\"The Question of Creativity\" | In this course we will focus on the question of creativity, taking as our tutor text Anna Abraham's book, The Neuroscience of Creativity. We will also consider a variety of other views by a range of artists, thinkers and psychologists, as well as the obvious fact that human creativity is always manifesting itself in new and unexpected ways. Moreover, since the brain itself operates by means of many networks and highly distributed systems, it will not be surprising to discover that creative acts are also the outcome of similar distributions; in other words, creative acts often seem to be the outcome of many unpredictable correlations. At the same time, it's not surprising that one creative act will often be followed by many others. Finally, we will consider the question that naturally besets educators: Can creativity be taught and learned?\n\n\nCourse requirements: Regular attendance (only two unexcused absences will be permitted); regular participation in class discussion; two essays (topics provided); a midterm exam based on the assigned readings, and a final research essay. This final essay can also draw upon and extend one of the earlier essays.",
