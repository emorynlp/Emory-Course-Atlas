The final 1/3 of the class will be devoted to students presenting perspectives of the Anthropocene from the point of view of various constituencies: plants, animals, soil, water, air, cities, agriculture, transportation, social/demographic human groups, locations, artists, natural scientists, humanities. Each student (or small groups of students) will pick one perspective, and prepare a short paper and class presentation/session delivered from that perspective.",
