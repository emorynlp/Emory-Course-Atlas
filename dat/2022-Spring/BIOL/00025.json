This field course will give the student a real hands-on rainforest experience complete with bromeliads, toucans, sloths, and the sounds of the night.   Graduating Seniors and students who have previously completed BIOL 371/ENVS 371 have priority for this course.  Cost for the trip is approximately $3100 (depending on airfare prices).    Permission of instructor is required.  This course is taught by Dr. Lawrence Wilson (lwilso3@emory.edu; adjunct faculty), is SHARED by the Biology and Environmental Science Departments, and may be taken as elective and upper-level laboratory credit for the biology major.  Submit applications to Barbara Shannon at barbara.shannon@emory.edu.  Selected students will be notified and will have additional requirements by OISP.  See the OISP website for additional information.",
