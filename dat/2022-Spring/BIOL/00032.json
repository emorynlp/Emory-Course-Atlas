The goal of this course is to provide students with a broad outline of ideas and current research areas in computational neuroscience, ranging from ion channels and the biophysics of single neurons up to brain-wide neural dynamics and organismal behavior. Class meetings will consist of a combination of lectures and in-class computational exercises.  Prerequisites:   Biology 360/NBB 301, or IBS 514.   Having a broad familiarity with neuroscience and possessing some basic knowledge of linear algebra and programming will likely prove useful.  This course may be taken as elective credit for the Biology major.",
