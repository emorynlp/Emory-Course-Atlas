Course Description:  In this course, students will read about environmental science and medicine from a variety of media; comparing scientific papers, journalism features, and fiction stories.  Students will grapple with the role of medium in conveying messages, the nature of evidence, and how social perspectives shape how we view science.  We will share science in two major ways:  students will write a news story about a recent scientific discovery and create an outreach lesson plan for a public science event.",
