This course continues the introduction of the basic grammar and syntax of classical Greek within its larger cultural context. The course aims to move students into reading selections from major classical authors as quickly as possible. In the second semester, we will be reading adapted selections from Plato, Aristophanes, historians, and the orators, chosen to illuminate the history and culture of ancient Greece at its zenith.\nTexts: (students enrolled for the first semester will already have these texts).\nJACT, Reading Greek:  Text & Vocabulary (Cambridge UP) ISBN: 978-0521698511 \n\tJACT, Reading Greek:  Grammar & Exercises (Cambridge UP) ISBN: 978-0521698528\nParticulars:  Quizzes, three or four tests, and a final examination. Classwork and homework are important components of the final grade.\nAs of now, the OUE is continuing to mandate that the Tu class be online, but it is my goal to move this to in-person instruction whenever possible.",
