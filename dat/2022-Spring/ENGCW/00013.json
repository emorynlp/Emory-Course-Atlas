We will examine the different dynamics at play when writing for bodies in performance through analysis of contemporary screenplays, theater texts, and virtual media. We will focus on composition, workshop, and production of original short form pieces to be supplemented by analytical discussion and written reflection on contemporary writers like Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Dominique Morisseau, Janicza Bravo, and Miranda July among others. Attendance to department readings, performances, and film screenings outside of class meetings will be required.",
