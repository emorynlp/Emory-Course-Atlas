This seminar is designated as the departmental component of the Laney Graduate School's TATTO requirements.  We address both theoretical as well as practical discussions of pedagogy.  Throughout the class we will cultivate our individual approaches to 'feminist pedagogy' and 'interdisciplinarity,' linking these themes to the practical aspects also of our teaching.  By the end of the class you will have created a syllabus and supporting materials (exams, projects) for WGS 200.",
