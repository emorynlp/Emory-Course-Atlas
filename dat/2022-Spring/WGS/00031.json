Is gender primarily a division of labor, a fundamental element of kinship, an erotic display, a compelled performance of norms, an internal identity, an artefact of white supremacy, or an anchor for the government of the life of populations? Is it possible to have gender without gender inequality, or is inequality part of the very ontology of gender? Is gender oppression more fundamental than race, class, or sexuality-based oppressions; is it a mere effect of these other oppressions, or does it intersect equally with them? Is the goal of a politics of gender justice to mitigate the harms of gender, to achieve gender equality, to multiply gendered possibilities, or to abolish gender altogether? This course will broach such questions by surveying theories of gender. We will attend to the relationship between theoretical claims about the origins of gender, local gendered experiences, and implied political futures.",
