We begin with early anthropological debates (from the 1970s) on \"the status of women\" , the prevalence of male dominance, and the ways scholars involved in these debates drew upon 19th- and early 20th-century theorists (such as Marx, Engels, Freud, and Levi-Strauss) to frame both their research questions and their contributions to these debates. We continue with an introduction to the work of Foucault on discourses of sexuality and gender hegemonies. Subsequent sections of the course explore non-binary systems of gender and sexuality and issues of pluralism, particularly in Southeast Asia and Native North America; \"sexual subcultures\" in the contemporary U.S.; genealogies of queer studies in the U.S. and beyond; Black feminist anthropology and intersectional perspectives on race, class, gender, sexuality, and stratified reproduction; and, finally, some of the implications for gender and sexuality of the recent global turn toward punitiveness, authoritarianism, conservativism, and illiberalism.",
