The course will cover the social historical and political context of the Northern Triangle; Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador and dialogues with the global contexts as it explores central questions on how have wars, genocide, criminal and political violence been gendered? How do Central American women narrate gender violence in relation to political violence? How during \"post conflict\" era women remember and narrate gender violence in war? In addition, this course expands on how the intersections of gender/sexuality, race/ethnicity, class, and other characteristics are reflected in women's experiences of gender-based violence such as incest, sexual harassment and feminicide. This course will cover fictional works and testimonies of writers such as Rigoberta Mench√∫, films, and performance.
