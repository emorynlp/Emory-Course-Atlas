Since Hillary Clinton lost the nearly won US election, and for some time before, there has been an outpouring of writing on women leaders across the globe. Provocative new histories of women leaders like Cleopatra of Egypt, Queen Victoria of England, Nur Jahan of India, and of powerful other women like RBG, Malala Yousafzai.  What is the reason? In this course we probe the history, the setting - and the most fundamental question of the evidence for women's power. The students will read the new histories, see films, and learn how scholars use the archives to explore new questions of power, erasure of historical figures, and center previously silenced figures to the center stage of world history. Our readings will include some of the new narrative histories, documentaries and art historical materials in order to understand the social, political and cultural dimensions that impact women's leadership.\"",
