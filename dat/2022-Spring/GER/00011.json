Preparation for class sessions will require either a short reading assignment of 3-5 pages or the completion of a short writing assignment (1-2 pages), which will then be workshopped during class. As a course capstone, students will revise and potentially expand one of their assignments and present it at a public reading at the end of the semester.",
