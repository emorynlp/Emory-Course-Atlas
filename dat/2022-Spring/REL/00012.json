What would it mean if this were true?  Could or should Jews care about the environment and climate change?  After wrestling with this possibility, the course examines contemporary Jewish environmental ethics alongside classic Jewish sources.  Conventional environmental theories--anthropocentric, theocentric and biocentric- will be investigated in preparation for developing a non-anthropocentric Jewish environmental ethic.",
