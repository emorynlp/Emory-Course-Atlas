The human body is a religious problem, but also a solution. How do religions try to solve the body's problems in order to get on with the more important business of salvation (of the mind or soul)? Or, might salvation lie in the body itself? Is the body an enemy or a friend to salvation? What role does sexual desire play, for example, in the various projects of salvation, liberation, or enlightenment? What are the relations of the body and truth?",
