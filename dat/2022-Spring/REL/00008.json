Throughout the more than 2,000 years yogic practices have existed, atheists, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Jains, Hindus, Sikhs, and other communities have all adapted yoga to meet their belief systems. We will see how yoga relates to nationalism, the law, and ideas about the soul and body, how yogic practices have been depicted in art, and how different communities have related yoga to various gods, goddesses, and philosophical concepts such as karma, reincarnation, and liberation. By examining how various communities have accepted or rejected the religiosity of yoga, we can see more clearly the contingency of \"religion\" through specific contexts.",
