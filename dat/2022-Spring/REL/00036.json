Students will work together with the professor to craft a collective project that includes a significant writing component but that may also include digital, audio, or other media elements. As a group, we will seek to educate ourselves on the most current work being done in public-facing scholarship on religion: from blogs, to podcasts, to newspapers, to music and the arts. We will seek to learn from scholars teaching and thinking about the public understanding of religion as we seek to contribute to that understanding ourselves.",
