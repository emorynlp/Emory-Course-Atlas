We will discuss the theological, political, and cultural commitments and debates that have shaped Catholicism over centuries. Given the diversity of Catholicism, what makes up a \"Catholic imagination\" or way of seeing the world? What beliefs, religious practices, and ethical frameworks make up Catholicism today? Throughout the semester, we will explore these questions not only by looking to history, but also by analyzing a number of contemporary issues including gender and sexuality, the environment, and Catholicism in the media. As we explore these various aspects of modern Catholicism, we will engage a number of resources including official church documents, theological texts, art and literature, pop culture, and ritual.",
