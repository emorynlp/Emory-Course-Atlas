    "class_notes": "This course, while open to all undergraduates, is a required course for undergraduate students at Emory majoring in Religion. The aim of the course is to introduce students to the study of religion as an academic field so that they may better situate their own research and writing within the larger landscape of modern scholarship in this area. Students will become familiar with major sociological, anthropological and hermeneutic approaches which pursue questions about the function, origin, comparison and language of religion. We will explore key terms in the contemporary study of religion such as culture, body, performance, rationality. Throughout, we will be concerned with the ways in which the category of religion has been and continues to be constructed by those who study it. This class is designed to increase students' methodological self-awareness as scholars of religion.",
