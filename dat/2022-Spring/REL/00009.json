This seminar course will explore who Harvey Milk was during his life (a \"New York Jew,\" a gay community activist, and a politician) and who he became after his death (a martyr and iconic figure). Through our focus on Milk's life and cultural \"afterlives,\" we will investigate the intersectional nature of identity, the construction and interpretation of \"hero\" and martyr figures, the nature of collective memory, the ways in which religious language and imagery are used to honor \"secular saints,\" and how conflicting claims are made for cultural icons.\n\n\n(Same as WGS 285 3 & JS 273 3)",
