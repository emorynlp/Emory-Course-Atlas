    "class_notes": "MCP Elective\n\n\nThe term \"camp\" has developed complex connotations in relation to contemporary media, often used in popular press both as a derogatory synonym for \"unserious\" and as an ill-defined superlative to elevate \"subversive\" queer-themed content. This course, however, will trace the evolutions of camp coding in American television through a variety of aesthetic, narrative, and ideological iterations, and will critically assess its valuation and affective significance for numerous lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA+) audiences and media producers. Through a diverse selection of exercises, students will grapple with the slippery nature of camp iconography, identification, and authorship via television studies methodological approaches including formal, press discourse, genre, production, and reception analyses. The class will be centered around writing, workshopping, and revision processes, culminating with either: 1.) An oral history (or autoethnography) about camp television's queer influence or 2.) A primary-source based research paper or video essay on a camp-oriented text.",
