NCDs are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. In addition to their considerable health impact, NCDs pose a critical threat to development.

The course highlights the burden and etiology of major NCDs, addresses approaches for surveillance of outcomes and risk factors, and lays out a comprehensive framework for prevention and control. The framework covers primary, secondary and tertiary prevention; population-level and individual-level approaches to\ndelivering interventions; and major principles and strategies necessary for effective prevention including evidence-based interventions, life-course perspective, health systems strengthening, whole-ofgovernment and multi-sectoral action, among others.\"",
