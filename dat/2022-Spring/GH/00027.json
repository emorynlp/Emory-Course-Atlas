Limited access to healthy foods at individual, household, and community level is associated with a range of health outcomes including malnutrition, depression, exposure to infectious diseases and chronic disease. This course will explore the determinants and outcomes of access to healthy foods, evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of existing food security strategies, and conduct community-engaged research in local communities on food access issues. State, national, and international policies and their influence on food access will be explored. Community-based strategies to ameliorate food access issues will be explored.",
