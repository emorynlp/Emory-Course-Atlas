The goal of this course is to help students learn to read social theory and identify key arguments in texts, tracing their development and evolution through time. We will aim to discern how key ideas associated with major authors are related to each other and map the networks by which they circulate. While courses such as these inevitably exclude far more than they can include, we will focus on theoretical approaches that have had enduring significance for later generations of social theorists. This course is open to anyone who is interested in exploring how do the social, cultural, political, and economic help us understand and conceptualize the world. The course is taught in English.\n\n\nThis course requires department consent. Please reach out to emills9@emory.edu to request enrollment.",
