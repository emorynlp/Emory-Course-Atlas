    "class_notes": "Course deals with Brazilian artists' creative responses to the challenges facing the nation, with emphasis on fiction, film, and music from the 20th and 21st centuries. This semester the course will examine ideas about Brazil through the metaphors of home and family, through the construction of the new capital in Brasília, and through searches for lost loved ones -- this last topic closely linked to political repression under military dictatorship. Students will develop their skills in critical reading and creative writing as well as their spoken and written Portuguese through regular practice, several short papers, and a final project that expands on one of the earlier papers. \nTEXTS: Authors will include Machado de Assis, Júlia Lopes de Almeida, João Guimarães Rosa, Clarice Lispector, Caio Fernando Abreu, and Bernardo Kucinski. Readings will be posted on Canvas, and films will be placed on reserve at Heilbrun Music and Media Library. \nPARTICULARS: Evaluation is based on daily and active participation, homework, compositions, and Portuguese program activities. \nPREREQUISITES: PORT 201 or equivalent. Students are strongly encouraged to take PORT 202 and/or PORT 212 before moving on to 300-level courses.",
