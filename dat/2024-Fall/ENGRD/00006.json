Translanguaging refers to multilingual learners' use of full linguistic repertoire without regard for socio-political boundaries between named languages in meaning making. This course aims to develop learners' knowledge of translanguaging and its pedagogical approach to writing that promotes multilingual learners' social, cultural, and linguistic rights and helps them realize their transformative potential to ensure social justice by eliminating inequalities and discriminations based on languages and cultures. Throughout the semester, students will respond to a variety of writing tasks and assignments along with in-class discussions aiming at developing their written communication skills for different rhetorical situations. This course takes a process writing approach to narrative writing, research project (conducting primary research), multimodal composition and reflection essay. Critical reading of articles and texts will help students understand the rhetorical process, analyze the audience and its cultural contexts, and foresee the audience's response.
