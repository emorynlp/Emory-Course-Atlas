This course will introduce a diverse corpus of Latin American environmental narratives, including films, novels, art, and travel literature. It will teach students about a new interdisciplinary field while mapping historically the ecological transformations of regions such as the Caribbean, the Amazon, the Andes, and Mesoamerica. The course addresses transnational and local issues such as the Columbian Exchange, the ecologies of slavery, the struggles over water and rivers, and the contradictions of modern cities. Temporally, the timeline ranges from processes of conquest and colonization to modern projects reshaping the world, the debate of the Anthropocene, and conversations of environmental justice and climate change. Foundational readings on eco-criticism and Latin American eco-criticism will provide the framework for our corpus.\n \nThis course can be used as one of the required 400-level courses for the Joint Major in Spanish & Linguistics or for the Major/Minor in Spanish.\n\n\nTEXTS: All readings are provided by the Instructor and are available on Canvas. \n \nEVALUATION:  Evaluation will be based on class participation & attendance  (10%), written responses --creative or academic-- (25%), quizzes (20%), research learning activities (10%), presentation (10%) and a final research presentation (25%)\n \nPREREQUISITES: One Foundational Course or an Official Spanish Placement for a Foundational Course Level.
