In this course we will study the politics of language in the Spanish-speaking world (especially the US, Latin America, Spain). The course will begin with an introduction to the main topics, concepts, and theoretical frameworks for the study of the politics of language (including language standardization, notions of \"correctness\" and monoglossia). We will then turn our attention to a range of local, national, and global contexts/topics that involve thinking and talking about Spanish as a political phenomenon, including: the historical invention of \"Spanish\"; the emergence and extension of Spanish as an imperial and national language; the creation, development, and activities of the Royal Spanish Academy, as well responses to them; the historical relations of Spanish with English in the US, as well as with minoritized languages in Spain and Latin America; language revitalization movements; educational issues involving the teaching and learning of Spanish in the US, Latin America, and Spain; use of and attitudes to varieties of Spanish in mass and virtual media; and calls for and debates about gender-inclusive language across and beyond the Spanish-speaking world.\n\n\nTEXTS: All readings will be made available on Canvas. \nEVALUATION: Evaluation will be based on participation, daily preparation, take-home tests/essays, an oral presentation, and a final project (a research paper, or a creative and/or public-facing project aimed at helping a broader public understand political issues of Spanish).",
