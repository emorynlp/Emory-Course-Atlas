This seminar examines Public Health and its relationship to the public's health. Among the questions we will consider are: How does illness, care, and cure intersect with the built environment and create unequal access to health care?  How have approaches to healing, health, and disease shifted across time and space? In what ways did popular health practices figure into everyday life and national programs? Historically, how have gender, ethnicity, citizenship status, and race shaped public health policies? How has medical practice and experimentation shaped, dismantled, and upheld discriminatory structures? Finally, how has the population at large engaged with and responded to various institutions, practitioners, and programs?  Students will investigate diverse actors through written, visual, and oral sources.",
