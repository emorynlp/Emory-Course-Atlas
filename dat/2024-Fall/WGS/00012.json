Reading across multiple genres, discourses, locations, diasporas, and historical moments, we will consider how racial gendered, and sexual assumptions take shape through colonialism, imperialism, labor systems, immigration policy, and militarism. We will also engage with Pacific-Islander and Asian-American self-understandings and self-representations, including the differences, alignments, and tensions that emerge through the commonly used \"AAPI\" grouping. Our topics will include race and feminism, gender, and militarism, colonial/racial gazes (exoticism, desexualization, hypersexualization), kinship and family, mental health, queer critique, and non-binary understandings of gender.",
