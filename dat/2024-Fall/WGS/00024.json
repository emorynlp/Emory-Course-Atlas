What do all these Freudian terms mean, and what is their relevance for contemporary feminist and queer theory? The aim of this course is two-fold: (1) to introduce students to the core concepts of Freudian psychoanalysis, and (2) to relate these psychoanalytic ideas to advanced work in feminist and queer theory. The course will begin by introducing students to the central theoretical concepts in Freud's metapsychology: instincts/drives, repression, the unconscious, dream interpretation. We will be particularly interested in how psychoanalysis challenges the notion of a unified, conscious subject. We will then read one of the most influential Freudian case histories: Dora (1905). In the second half of semester, the course will focus on one particular part of Freudian theory: the construction of masculinity and femininity and its relation to sexuality. We will start with an examination of the perverse and corporeal nature of infantile sexuality, and use this to investigate psychoanalytic accounts of adult sexuality. In the final weeks of the course, we will undertake an intensive investigation of the death drive and its uses in feminist and queer theory, especially in relation to film.",
