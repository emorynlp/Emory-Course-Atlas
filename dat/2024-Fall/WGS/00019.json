The subtext of all security-talk is about protecting certain populations from danger. Security is often implemented through subtle techniques and unpredictable populations. In this course, we will consider these techniques of security and surprising populations: debilitation, environmental sedimentation, military practices, climate refugees, and the reversal of security logics. that is, how and when victims become oppressors. We will read some of the following authors, who think about these questions in various traditions: , Jasbir Puar, Paul Amar, Saba Mahmood, Achille Mbembe, Hagar Kotef, Sherene Razack, Sunera Thobani, Francoise Verges, and others.",
