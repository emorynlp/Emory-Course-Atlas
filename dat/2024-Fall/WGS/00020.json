We will examine the critical texts and debates that have shaped and reshaped the contemporary field of WGSS in the US. We will look carefully at how specific texts, arguments, and assumptions are taken up and circulated as foundations for scholarly work in WGSS, only to be taken up and contested again. We will explore how theory, political movements, and everyday practices become institutionalized as the academic field of WGSS. We will also pay close attention to how an academic field is always unsettled and how we can locate ourselves in relation to those ongoing scholarly transformations.",
