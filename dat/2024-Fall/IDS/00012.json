    "class_notes": "This class examines the relationship between religion, self-care, and consumerism. We start with a simple premise; the way we take care of ourselves is political. Whether we realize it or not, many of us engage with religion in our daily lives. If you have seen Star Wars, used a yoga mat or meditation app, or attended a Burning Man festival, you have encountered religion. What does it mean when aspects of a religious tradition are transformed into consumer products? What cultural, ethical, and personal dilemmas emerge when religious ideas and objects are used for self-care separate from their religious context? Who decides which religions to borrow from, and which parts of those religions are 'extractible'? What role do global power dynamics between the so-called 'West' and the so-called 'East' play in shaping this phenomenon? How do we approach practices like mindfulness, which have been scientifically proven to have health benefits, when they are sometimes viewed as forms of cultural appropriation?  Who can afford to participate in a consumerist wellness culture? Are there anti-capitalist forms of self-care? These are all questions we will consider in this class. We will approach the topic through interdisciplinary perspectives from religious studies, postcolonial theory, and popular culture. During class, students will have the opportunity to critically examine and experientially engage with contemporary self-care and wellness practices.",
