IDS 200W introduces students to the Liberal Arts and supports student's studies in a wide range of majors. Systematic focus on writing essential in any career. // What counts as evidence in different fields of human knowledge? Do we have evidence of things unseen, e.g. gods, tradition, love, existence after death, meaning? In the ancient tragedy \"Antigone\" , for example, a young woman defies the law for love of her brother. But could the young woman's love, her thinking, speech patterns, and motivations be due to genetic dispositions, neural mechanisms, religious extremism, or mental disorder? Such questions highlight the problematic nature of evidence and explanation that we will examine.",
