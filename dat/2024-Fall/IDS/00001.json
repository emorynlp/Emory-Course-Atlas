Students will read the Republic in its entirety, then compare this ancient philosophical work to contemporary texts, including films (e.g. Network, The Matrix, The Truman Show and the series Black Mirror), music (e.g. Childish Gambino, This is America), and literature (e.g. selections from Dostoyevsky and Hawthorne). Our goal will be to understand contemporary issues better through the lens offered by Plato.)\n\n\n(Freshmen Seminar - Limited to First Year Students Only)",
