We will learn to apply the basic principles of epidemiology and biostatistics to identification and analysis of public health issues. We will discuss the applications, strengths, and limitations of epidemiological studies. Topics will include study design, measure of disease frequency and association, sampling, causation, bias, confounding, and how to critique epidemiologic literature. This course is central for human health majors, required for global health minors and fundamental for students interested in predictive health or nutrition. The content for this 3-credit course will be delivered during the live sessions as well as through pre-recorded content. Students can expect to spend an average of 2.5 hours each week learning the course content.",
