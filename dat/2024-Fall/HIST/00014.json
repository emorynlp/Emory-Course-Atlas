It begins with African civilizations in ancient times and runs through the 1880s, when the African continent was divided into European colonies. It concentrates on people and civilizations indigenous to Africa. The origins of Islam, the Atlantic slave trade, and European explorers and missionaries receive attention mainly in their African aspects. The emphasis on Africa in this course provides a valuable alternative perspective on these, and other, seemingly familiar events. We will also explore the reshaping of Africa's political economy during the 5th BCE to the 19th Century.",
