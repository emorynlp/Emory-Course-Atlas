    "class_notes": "This course deals with the memory/history of the Partition of British India in 1947. Partition resulted in the establishment of the nation-states of India, Pakistan and (in time) Bangladesh. The course investigates official and unofficial histories of this critical moment, when perhaps a million people died and over ten million became refugees in the subcontinent, and juxtaposes them with the memories of people who lived through the times. It lays emphasis on close reading and discussion to develop a critical approach to the understanding of modern societies and contested versions of history. We examine views of the past and the present that emerge in the new nation-states through a variety of primary and secondary sources: (1) official and academic histories, media, fiction and films; (2) oral accounts reflecting the new identities and perspectives of local groups, communities and regions, divided as these are by gender, caste and class.",
