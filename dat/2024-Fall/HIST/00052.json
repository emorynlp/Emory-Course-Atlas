Despite their iconic nature which branded the Soviet Union an \"evil empire,\" the Gulag is remarkably poorly understood as a reality, rather than a symbol.  The network of penal servitude camps was not static, it was not a network of concentration camps, and it was not as large or deadly as it is usually considered in the popular imagination.  Most importantly, the GULag has a history.  The camps were not a static, free-floating system of oppression but a carceral network whose goals, methods of operation and level of lethality differed from era to era.  The GULag also is a story of resistance, a resistance so successful it was swiftly abandoned after the death of Stalin.  We will study this institution from the macro-level of the network and the stories of those enmeshed in it, either as prisoners or jailers.  This class meets the Continuing Communications GER.",
