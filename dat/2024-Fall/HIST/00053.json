The blood libel \"the accusation that Jews ritually murder Christian children\" was popular in the medieval and early modern periods and then petered out with the Reformation and critiques of popular superstition.  It exploded again in the last decades of the nineteenth century until about World War I, now aided and articulated through mass media and communication, modern political and judicial systems, and the language of science, medicine, and rationality.  Our seminar goals are to historicize antisemitic ideas and violence and understand them in their precise historical context, and to rethink the role of religion, popular belief, and the power of rumor in modern times.",
    "course_description": "Jr/Sr Colloquium. \nThis seminar will explore continuities and innovations between the medieval and modern blood libels, especially how the modern accusation was a product of post-Enlightenment politics, fears, and conventional social knowledge.",
