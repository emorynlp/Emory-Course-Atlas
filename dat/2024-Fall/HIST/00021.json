    "class_notes": "Renaissance women left an astonishing textual legacy ranging from letters, orations, and memoirs to treatises, plays, and imaginative tales. This course focuses on selected texts to investigate how European women used writing to shape, interpret, and comment on the world around them between 1400 and 1600, a period that witnessed the advent of printing, the break-up of Christianity, and early globalization. In exploring the ways that writing offered a vehicle for personal expression and agency, we will also probe the barriers that Renaissance women faced in becoming literate and in publishing their work. By situating women's writing in the context of family life, political rule, and sex work, the course aims to introduce students to a broad range of women's historical experiences while improving critical reading, writing, and communication skills. Readings focus on primary sources available electronically; we will make regular use of visual materials to bring the period to life. Grading: short written assignments, one longer essay, oral presentations, class participation, and rotating turns as discussion leader. No examinations.",
