    "class_notes": "How did the society we know as `America' emerge? Where did it come from? Why did it evolve in the way it did? What were the key elements of its development? Using readings in primary and secondary sources (including movies), and organized around both lectures and discussion, History 231 explores these issues from the originating years of American History through Reconstruction. Focusing on central strands of social, cultural, and political history, the course rests on two guiding assumptions: that an informed awareness of the present begins with a responsible and sophisticated understanding of the past; and that learning about early American history provides important insight into the American story as a whole.",
