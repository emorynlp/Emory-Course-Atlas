This course explores these and other questions bearing on 'work' and 'workers' by examining various laboring populations during the 19th and 20th centuries in countries across the Americas. We will focus on particular case studies, eras, and industries in select countries of this large geographic region (certainly including the US, Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia). And we will thoroughly engage the concept of class. This broad, comparative framework will provide a rich understanding of the range of experiences men and women had with phenomena like slavery, industrialization, and domestic labor. It will also deepen our appreciation for how these people responded to their situations.",
