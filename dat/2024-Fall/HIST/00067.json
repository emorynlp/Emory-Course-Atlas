    "class_notes": "This course introduces students to the field of environmental history: the study of how humans have interacted with the environment in the past and how each side - humans and the natural environment - were affected by these interactions. To situate ourselves, we open the semester with a definition of the field and some of its early, defining works. To get a sense on which scale environmental histories can be written, we engage studies at regional, transnational, and global scales. In topical terms, we encounter histories of nature conservation and national parks, histories of rivers, animal history, restoration ecology, nuclear history, and ecofeminism. We address a wide range of geographic settings and most of the works focus on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The class is suitable for students regardless of geographical focus.",
