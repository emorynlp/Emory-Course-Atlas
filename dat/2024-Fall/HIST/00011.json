Learning about them opens a window into the core yearnings of Jewish culture as well as into human nature. This course asks the following, among other questions; what is Jewish mysticism? How do you become a mystic? Why was mysticism at times limited to very small groups and at others interwoven into large religious movements? What were the premises and the promises of messianism? When and why did waves of messianism come about? Who were the figures who perceived themselves as messiahs?\nWe will explore ancient to modern forms of Jewish religious experiences and histories between Europe and the Land of Israel. Students examine the intricate questions and paradoxes that the pluralities of Jewish religious experiences, especially between 1200-1800, elicit. Drawing on scholarly debates and a rich variety of contemporary sources, we will study the flourishing and decline of mysticism and messianism, religious conversion and reversion, and their relationships to gender, authority, and secularism. Students experiment with methodologies in the study of religious materiality, book, and manuscript cultures in class and in special library sessions.)",
