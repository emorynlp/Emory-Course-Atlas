It uses art and literature to investigate various aspects of society, the economy, culture, religion, and politics. Key topics include Japan's relations with the outside world; the rise of the imperial institution; and the evolution of aristocratic, samurai, and townspeople's culture. In broader terms, our approach will draw attention to such theoretical issues as the tensions between center & peripheries; identity (self and Other; insiders and outsiders); and history from above versus history from below. Previous knowledge of Japanese history or Japanese language welcome, but not required.",
