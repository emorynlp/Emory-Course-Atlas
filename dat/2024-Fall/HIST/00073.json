Students will distinguish, compare, and appraise different modes of presenting and analyzing material in the classroom. During the course of the semester, students will produce two polished syllabi, one of which will be the course they will teach in a subsequent semester to Emory undergraduates. The course will largely revolve around preparation for that course: students will construct assignments, create lesson plans, and conduct a mock teaching exercise. \nRequired Texts:\nPeter Filene, The Joy of Teaching: A Practical Guide for New College Instructors 0807856037",
