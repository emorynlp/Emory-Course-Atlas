Students will explore the ways Jewish tradition has adapted to America, how patterns of communal life have been transformed, what the relationship of American Jews has been to other Americans and to the international Jewish community, and how American Jewish identities have been created from Jews' dual impulses for integration and distinctiveness. We will also use the Jewish experience as a means of evaluating different definitions of American national identity.",
