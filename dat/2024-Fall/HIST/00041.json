    "class_notes": "The Italian Renaissance was one of the most dynamic, transformative periods in Western history. This course analyzes the politics, society, and culture of Renaissance Italy from the Black Death circa 1350 to the collapse of the Italian state system circa 1530. It aims to identify major turning points in this period, its overall trajectory, and broader historical significance, while also placing these developments in larger global contexts. Topics include the revival of classical learning; political innovations in Italian city-states and shifts in the geopolitical order; the expansion of transnational commercial networks; marriage and family life; the origins of the African slave trade; religious practices, the rise of the Renaissance papacy, and the growth of antisemitism. Readings include secondary works as well as various primary sources ranging from letters and diaries to Machiavelli's The Prince. We will integrate discussions, digital resources, and visual materials into lectures on a regular basis. Grading: class participation, quizzes, one short paper, take-home midterm exam, and final take-home exam.",
