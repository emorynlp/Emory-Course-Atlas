Experience in Python and/or NLP is recommended but not required.\n\n\nHow can natural language processing and other machine learning techniques be applied to humanities data? What new knowledge can they reveal? What are their limits? This course, paired with a humanities graduate seminar, will explore these questions in theory and practice. We will read scholarship about historical archives and then work as a class to produce quantitative analyses of the textual data of the National Archives. This work will inform a series on the 250th anniversary of the United States being produced by Alabama Public Television.\n\n\nThis course meets with ENG 790.",
