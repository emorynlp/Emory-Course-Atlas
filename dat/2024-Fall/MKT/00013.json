Becoming a compelling storyteller is your best chance to break through. The Content Marketing course is useful for anyone that needs to present to a stakeholder: brand to consumers, consultant to client or entrepreneur to investors. We will examine key social and digital platforms and how each monetizes. To dig into creating content, we explore sticky ideas, storytelling through screenplays and brand archetype.",
