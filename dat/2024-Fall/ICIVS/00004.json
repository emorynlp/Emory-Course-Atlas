It is designed to expand student's capability to read, translate, annotate and analyze Urdu literary sources to deepen their research skills. The seminar will present students with readings in prose and poetry, focusing on Sufi and Sufi-influenced texts about love, longing and desire. The seminar will give students experience in various poetic genres (masnavi, ghazal, ruba'i, mukhammas and musaddas), consider how poems are rendered in song as well as print, and teach how dates are encoded in texts (abjad). The seminar will also consider issues of transliteration and translation.
