As they say: \"Here in the South, we don't hide crazy; we parade it on the front porch and give it a cocktail.\"  This course aims to better understand the unique politics of the fastest-growing region of the United States - home to about one in three Americans - and to better understand American politics as a whole and the world around us.  In this course, we will seek to understand how race, class, economics, immigration, and religion all had a hand in shaping the landscape of Southern and American politics.  By the end of this class, you will hopefully develop a deep sense of understanding and appreciation for this often maligned region and its people.",
