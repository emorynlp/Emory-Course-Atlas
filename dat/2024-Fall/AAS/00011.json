Employing a comparative religion approach, we explore Black Atlantic religious themes such as: God(s), spirit, and ancestor veneration, divination and sacred space, initiation and sacred arts, healing and the environment, gender and power, the impact of slavery on conversion/continuity, migration and diaspora. Ultimately, this introductory course encourages students to reevaluate their understanding of Africana religions as they gain familiarity with diverse cultural philosophies and ritual knowledge systems of these valuable ancestral traditions.",
