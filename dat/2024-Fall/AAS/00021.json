In particular, the course tracks a genealogy of the prison, the criminal justice system, and practices of policing in particular from regimes of racial slavery and lynching. While the course is attentive to the sociological literature on mass incarceration past and present, the objective of the course is to think conceptually and historically about the ways in which racial slavery operates as foundational to the systemic and institutionalized forms of inequality in the United States",
