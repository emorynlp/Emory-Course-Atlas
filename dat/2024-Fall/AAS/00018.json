Can we imagine black existence without reason, the transparent subject, formalized schemes of knowledge, and being? How has anti-blackness (de)structured our relationship to time, space, and thinking? Is it time to abandon the human as an organizing concept for liberation and freedom? Using black psychoanalysis, black feminist poethics, ecological studies, Afro-pessimism, semiotics, black humanism, and black theology, we will address these concerns. Ultimately, we will sketch the infrastructure of black thought and evaluate the efficacy of various methodologies and noetic practices. This course will celebrate (and critically evaluate) the beauty of black thinking, its innovation, and development. The reading is primarily philosophical and theoretical (with artistic and cinematic engagements).",
