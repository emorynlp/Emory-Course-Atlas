The course will investigate how African American hairstyles, colorism, and family structure are used as signals of class in film. If race is portrayed using skin color, hair texture, etc, how is class portrayed? What signs are we looking for when we hear 'black middle class' that might be different from just 'American middle class'?\n\n\n(Freshmen Only)",
