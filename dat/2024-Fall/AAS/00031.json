    "class_notes": "Topic:  Women, Race, and Lethal Punishment in U.S. History\nThis course will explore how race and gender intersect with the history of lethal punishment in the United States. Specifically, we will examine the disproportionate representation of Black women among the condemned and consider how Black and White women navigated capital punishment and appeals for leniency. Grounded in history, our exploration will take a more non-traditional approach in the sense that we will read customary historical monographs as well as primary sources, but also we will investigate how the death penalty, technologies of death, and women's experiences of it operate in society and popular culture more broadly.",
