While placing a primary emphasis on literary arts and authors, we will approach both movements as complex interdisciplinary, multi-generic phenomena concerned with Black freedom struggles. As we \"map\" the histories of these two major movements, we will consider the ways artists and critics alike have constructed these movements, the relationships of these movements to each other and to Black Studies, and the processes and politics that shape notions of literary history, race, gender, sexuality, and culture in American society.",
    "course_description": "This course will examine the relationships of black cultural movements to their historical periods and approach the movements as interdisciplinary phenomena. Movements that have been covered in the past include the Black Arts Movement, the New Negro Renaissance, and the Black Power movement.",
