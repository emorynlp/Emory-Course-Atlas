    "course_description": "Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a valuable tool for business, public health, health care, marketing, and many other disciplines. ABM fills a niche that other approaches cannot fill; therefore, they are often used in complement to other approaches. ABM is used for modeling types of markets, pandemics, supply chains, strategies, policies, collaborations, and many other collective dynamic phenomena. This is a programming course that has no programming prerequisites. In this course you will learn the fundamentals of computational modeling, running ABM experiments, basic data analytics and visualization.",
