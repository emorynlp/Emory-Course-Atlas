The field of data visualization combines the art of graphic design with the science of data analytics. Students will learn how to perform exploratory analysis through visualization, how to create professional looking visualizations for use in business reports and presentations, and how to design interactive visualizations and dashboards that include time series, rankings, proportions, deviations, frequencies and distributions, correlations, categorical comparisons, and geospatial plots. Students will analyze real data sets and utilize R, Python, Tableau, and other tools to design and prototype their visualizations.Â \nThis course is for MSBA students only.",
