    "class_notes": "Racial Capitalism & the City\nCities all over the world are constantly and rapidly changing. Officials and elites seek to transform their cities, to make them \"modern,\" \"smart,\" and \"world-class,\" more attractive for investment, and better places to live for particular socioeconomic groups. This course encourages students and the instructor to think critically and broadly about such projects that transform urban spaces and communities. Together, we will ask questions such as: Who benefits and profits from these projects? Who is being displaced, marginalized, and policed? What racialized and classed logics do officials and elites use to promote and justify these projects? How do historic and contemporary urban transformations in Atlanta impact our daily lives, and those of our neighbors? How does each of these questions help us understand the overarching extractive system of racial capitalism, and, in turn, how does racial capitalism help conceptually link all of these questions across contexts?\n\n\nBy collectively thinking through these and other questions - and via students posing their own - we will gain new perspectives and analytical lenses that will broaden our worldviews and encourage us to situate our own lives in relation to urban transformations at local, national, and global scales. Key concepts will include but not be limited to racial capitalism, gentrification, colonialism, underdevelopment, popular economies, and urban \"modernity.\" Course readings pull heavily from Urban Anthropology, as well as other disciplines (Urban Studies; Sociology; Black Studies; Philosophy) and scholarly traditions that elide neat disciplinary boundaries.",
