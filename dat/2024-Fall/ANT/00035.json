We will consider works that delve into the structures, meanings, and experiences of the colonial project in different geographic spaces. We will also explore the nature of present-day structures of power and governmentality embedded in economic restructuring, international development, and humanitarianism. Themes will include contemporary forms of racialization, the role of state violence, the nature of post-colonial critique and activism, and possibilities of liberation. Course materials will span the disciplines of anthropology, history, and cultural criticism.",
