This course investigates relational and comparative studies that center the formation of racial categories, hierarchies, and identities in the Americas. We will pay particular attention to 19th-21st century histories of how populations have been racialized/minoritized (i.e. Black, Native, Latinx, Arab, Asian) and the ways such histories intersect and diverge from each other. Organized chronologically and thematically, our shared readings will guide us through topics and questions related to indigeneity, race, ethnicity, legality, gender, and diasporic/transnational communities. Students will develop an original research paper over the course of the semester.",
