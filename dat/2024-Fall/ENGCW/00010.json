We will explore the basic elements of storytelling - concept, character, plot, structure, dialogue, etc. -- and how each is used in writing for the screen. Students will also learn the format used for film scripts. Throughout the semester, students will write a complete treatment and the first act of an original screenplay, drawing from these theories.  Classes will involve reading and analyzing professional screenplays and also watching films. Students will engage in roundtable discussion of each student's work. Classes will be conducted as workshops in which the main emphasis is on the students' own work, with in-class lecture, film clip review, group writing exercises and open discussion. Students should budget for printing/scripts/videos.",
