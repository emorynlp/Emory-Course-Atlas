Complete course atlas information (including texts and grading) and application form will be available on the Creative Writing Program website in LATE MARCH: https://creativewriting.emory.edu/index.html. Please email nora.lewis@emory.edu if you have any questions.\n\n\nThis is an introduction to the art of fiction writing for beginning students. The roots of storytelling will be explored, and elements of the fiction writer's craft will be introduced and practiced (desire/conflict, character development, point of view, dialogue, showing vs. telling, structure, etc.). We will also closely read and examine selected works of published short fiction, though the occasional interdisciplinary model of music, film, and other mediums will be considered - all with an eye toward identifying and generating character and story, and learning how to \"read like a writer.\" Students will complete writing exercises and shorter pieces of fiction, as well as one longer story that will be workshopped. Students will also be expected to analyze and discuss in-depth both the work-in-progress of fellow students and published stories; thusly, class participation is not optional. (Note: we will center character-based literary fiction, meaning this course is not one in which genres like fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, horror, romance, etc. will be read or written.) This course will prepare students for intermediate-level workshops in fiction.",
