Challenging popular myths and oversimplified explanations, we will view the genocide of European Jews as a historical event neither inevitable nor inexplicable and consider its implications for the present. Our particular window into the Holocaust history and representation will be diverse forms of visual storytelling, from medieval anti-Judaist images, through series of paintings created by Jews in hiding and American comic books from the 1940s in which superheroes fought Nazis, to second- and third-generation graphic memoirs.",
