How do we build lives that are meaningful to us -- and that produce positive effects for others?  These are some of the biggest questions we can ask as human beings, and they are not idle ones.  We show our answers to these questions in how we actually live.  \nWe will discuss possible meanings of life in conversation with a wide variety of readings and other media. On the way, we will consider situations and choices we all encounter: our educational choices, our choice of career (including medicine, among other professions), personal relationships, and how we navigate life stages.  We will talk about music and art.  We will discuss what we enjoy, and what we don't, in our lives.\n\n\nSome of our class texts will be philosophical, some literary, some historical, some filmic.  The writing for the class will be exploratory and reflective, not expository.  This class fulfills the Freshman Seminar GER.\nThis is a discussion class: we are in this together.  We learn from one another as well as from our readings, so bring yourselves to the table.  Your attendance and participation are essential to the success of this course and to its learning goals.  We build these conversations together, as an activity in community.  \nTexts:\n-\tThe Trial and Death of Socrates, Plato (Hackett; trans.
