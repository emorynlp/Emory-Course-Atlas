    "class_notes": "This course satisfies the Religion major requirement: - Theme.\nOur seminar will explore a single, though not a simple, question:  \nWhat is human goodness?  What sorts of lives are good lives?  How might goodness relate to our flourishing?  \n-Our approach will be broadly philosophical. We will read and discuss together a range of texts as we pursue our questions about goodness, ethics, and forms of life.  Some texts will be philosophical and theological, some biographical, some literary, some filmic.   \n-This is a discussion class: we are in this together.  We learn from one another as well as from our readings, so bring yourselves to the table. Your attendance and participation are required and are essential to the success of this course and to its learning goals.  \nThere will be a range of readings and other media as food for thought, most accessible through Canvas reserves.  The following texts are available through Emory Bookstore: \n-Plato, Trial and Death of Socrates, trans. Grube (Hackett ed.)\n-Douglass, Frederick.  Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (Norton ed.)\n-Kidder, Mountains Beyond Mountains",
