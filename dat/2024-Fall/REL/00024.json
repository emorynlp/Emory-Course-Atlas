    "class_notes": "This course satisfies the Religion major requirement:- Tradition-Christianity.\nThis course offers an academic introduction to Christianity, arguably world history's most consequential tradition, religious or otherwise. Reading its key texts and studying its varied communities, we explore Christianity's historical developments up to the early modern period (i.e., the 1500s), as well as its cross-cultural expressions. We attend especially to the political contexts of what is now the world's most populous religion - its emergence as an anti-imperial movement in first-century Palestine and early spread into Asia and Africa, its eventual alliance with the Roman Empire and consolidations in Europe, and its modern-era expansion into the Americas and other colonized lands.",
