The course meets once a week for 100 minutes, during which time students will be treated to a presentation by one of Emory University's many scholars of religion. Students will get a taste of the variety of methods used by these scholars in their study of religion - including literary, historical, philosophical, anthropological, art historical, cultural, and sociological. Topics may cover major religious traditions such as Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, Taoism, or African religions. Themes will introduce particular lenses such as gender, sexuality, race, ethics, politics, or media through which to consider religion. Prior to each session, students will prepare an accessible article or other source provided by the guest teacher, and will also post a response to this material. Subsequent to class, students will post a second response reflecting on the guest's presentation and the ensuing discussion. There are no other major assignments or exams.",
