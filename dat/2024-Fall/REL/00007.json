My cellphone buzzes and I lose track of what my neighbor was trying to tell me; I head to the library to get in a few solid hours of studying, but a daydream catches and derails me; I throw myself into an exciting new project and in a few months have all but forgotten about my closest friend. We may never be able to completely eliminate our tendency to distraction. What we can do, however, is try to combat this tendency - that is, try to work on our attention. In this course, we will read a number of philosophical essays and poems in order to explore the nature of attention and its role in living a fulfilling life, as well as discover techniques of cultivating it. The readings are drawn from a range of traditions, and include the writings of Simone Weil, Pierre Hadot, Patanjali, Iris Murdoch, Buddhist nuns, and Emily Dickinson.",
