The course takes mythmaking as a starting point for inquiry and analysis in determining how religion functions within and beyond institutional religion.  Grounded in religious studies theoretical approaches to myth and religion, it explores America's heritage of antiblackness and mythmaking as a religious phenomenon alongside the role that mythmaking has played in Black religions and spiritual cultures that disavow \"Myth America,\" uncooperatively endure the omnipotence of antiblackness, and construct identities that exceed the confines of racial Blackness.",
