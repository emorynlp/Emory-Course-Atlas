In so doing, the course invites students to engage some of the basic questions of human existence: What does it mean to be human? What are the possibilities of freedom? How do we find purpose in life? How do we face death? In the first part of the course, we examine how existentialism has critically engaged basic philosophical, religious, and social assumptions of the modern West. In the second part, we turn to major themes of existentialism and how they constitute what it is to exist as a person: dynamic, multiplex, and irreducible to essences and identities. Finally, we examine how religious thinkers across multiple traditions, as well as religion scholars across multiple disciplines, have drawn from and built on existential insights in positing religion in terms not of essence and truth, but rather of existence and ambiguity.\n\n\n(Cancelled xx/xx/xx)",
