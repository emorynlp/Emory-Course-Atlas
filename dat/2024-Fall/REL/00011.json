    "class_notes": "This course satisfies the Religion major requirement:- Theme.\nReligion and law are both relevant to our diverse and divided society, but do they intersect? If so, where and how? Scholars abound who are fascinated with the \"religious dimensions of law, the legal dimensions of religion, and the interaction of legal and religious ideas and institutions, methods and practices - historically and today.\" This course focuses on this interdisciplinary and path-breaking field of religion and law. We will consider the theories and methods that scholars and scholar-practitioners of all sorts (lawyers, clergy, teachers, students, and more) use to challenge assumptions and contribute new perspectives that lead to novel insights impossible without crossing disciplinary borders. We will begin by discussing the nature of the field: what do we mean by \"law\" or \"religion\"? What sort of areas of human experience does \"religion and law\" address? By reading, analyzing, and critiquing examples of cutting-edge scholarship, we'll focus not just on what scholars talk about - everything from religious freedom, accommodations, practices, education, to views on human rights, pluralism, norms and values, religious laws and cultures - but also how they talk about them.\n\n\nBy the end of our time together, students will have a deeper understanding of the scope and range of subjects covered by the field, as well as of different methodological approaches to scholarship. Equipped with these new tools and understandings, students will have a foundation upon which to develop their own interests in dialogue with the larger scholarly landscape and the opportunity to develop those interests further through a term paper on a course topic of their choosing.",
