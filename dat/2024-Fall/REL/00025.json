It meets for two synchronous 75-minute sessions per week on MW.\nThis course satisfies the Religion major requirement: - Tradition-Christianity, Theme. \nDeath is a central category in the history of religious life. It is, more importantly, one of the few constants throughout human history. Because of its reality in our own lives and the world around us, it would seem to be an important subject to discuss. But how should we discuss it? Like sexuality, aging, and drugs, death is a universal aspect of human life, experience, and embodiment. In this class we will tackle the subject head-on in a scholarly environment focused on inquiry, discussion, and reflection.",
