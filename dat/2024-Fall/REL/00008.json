We will explore the literature of the Hebrew Bible as the work of ancient authors and editors addressed to their ancient audiences. We will also investigate how this literature has been interpreted and understood over centuries by Jews and Christians, with particular attention to Jewish traditions of interpretation (such as midrash). While the course will give significant attention to how various communities identify, interpret, and appeal to the Hebrew Bible as sacred and authoritative, no particular position of belief about the Hebrew Bible will be assumed or required for participation in the course, nor will any prior knowledge of the Hebrew Bible be expected. Students of all knowledge backgrounds will be welcomed in this course.",
