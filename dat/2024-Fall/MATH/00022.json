Topics include numerical linear algebra, image compression, clustering, classification, regression, numerical methods for least-squares problems, large-scale numerical optimization, nonlinear regression, and unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.  The course introduces students to theory and methods for data science, and students get hands-on experience working on examples from a variety of applications.\nPrerequisites: MATH 221 (Linear Algebra) and MATH 211 (Advanced Calculus) or MATH 210 (Advanced Calculus for Data Sciences), some experience with MATLAB, Python, or a similar package will be helpful. \nPlease contact undergraduate coordinator Taylr Tuggle (taylr.annece.tuggle@emory.edu) to request permission.",
