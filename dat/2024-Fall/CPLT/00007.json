In some cases, that which is unthought is due to neglect, repression, or obfuscation. In other cases, the unthought is a structural feature of thought itself. Oftentimes, one cannot tell whether the unthought is a result of the former or the latter. This course attends to each of these permutations of what remains unthought in the literatures of creative writing, speculative philosophy, negative theology, psychoanalysis, black study, queer theory, settler decoloniality, and geology. In 2003, the cultural historian Saidiya Hartman coined the phrase \"the position of the unthought\" to describe how the logics of chattel slavery continue to haunt a post-emancipation world. In 1987, the literary critic Hortense Spillers theorized this position--exemplified in the \"ungendered female flesh\" --as the \"zero degree\" of modern social conceptualization. In 1952, the philosopher and psychiatrist Frantz Fanon theorized how colonial social conceptualizations rendered black people into that which \"is not\" (n'est pas).\n\n\nThis course attends to the position of the unthought across a variety of disciplinary sites.

Oftentimes, one cannot tell whether the unthought is a result of the former or the latter. This course attends to each of these permutations of what remains unthought in the literatures of creative writing, speculative philosophy, negative theology, psychoanalysis, black study, and queer theory.\n\n\nIn 2003, the cultural historian Saidiya Hartman formulated the position of the unthought to describe how the logics of chattel slavery continue to haunt a post-emancipation world. In 1987, the literary critic Hortense Spillers theorized this position as the zero degree of modern social conceptualization. In 1952, the philosopher and psychiatrist Frantz Fanon theorized how colonial social conceptualizations rendered black people into that which is not.\n\n\nFanon's formulation resembles the Christian tradition of apophatic theology beginning in the 5th Century, which contended that the divine can only be said or known in terms of what it is not. In a similar vein, at the turn of the 20th Century, Sigmund Freud invented psychoanalysis as a therapeutic method of attending to the unconscious as that constitutive feature of the psyche whose effects can only be spoken or known indirectly.\n\n\nThis course will ask how literature, broadly conceived, offers a unique vehicle for orienting ourselves to these various iterations of the position of the unthought.\n\n\nTEXTS: Authors may include (in addition to the above): Plato, Pseudo-Dionysius, Marguerite Porete, Juan de la Cruz, W.
