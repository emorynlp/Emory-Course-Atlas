    "class_notes": "\"Marxism, Literature, Culture\" | \"This course will focus on the problem of literature and culture in Marxist theory.  We will read selected texts by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Antonio Gramsci, V.N. Volo≈°inov, Mikhail Bakhtin, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Adorno, Raymond Williams, E.P. Thompson, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, Henri Lefebvre, Michel de Certeau, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, Stuart Hall, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Donna Haraway.  Although our class discussions and written assignments will be based on our assigned course readings, we may also draw from literature and other cultural forms beyond our assigned readings in order to illustrate their different and sometimes conflicting theoretical approaches.\"\n\n\nStudents will not only learn about these different approaches to literature and culture and their relationship with one another, but they will also learn how to read theoretical texts and write scholarly papers.
