We cover data types, control flow, object-oriented programming, and graphical user interface-driven applications. Students will learn to work with packages, data structures, and tools for data science and cybersecurity. The examples and problems used in this course are drawn from diverse areas such as text processing, simple graphics creation and image manipulation, HTML and web programming, and genomics.",
