A central text for this course is the decolonial symposium hosted by Emory University and co-hosted by Clark-Atlanta University during the same semester, where students will dynamically engage with seminar fellows in art, literature, anthropology, philosophy and Black spiritual work. Students in this seminar will study seminal texts as well as new decolonial materials presented to them in the form of lectures, working papers, workshops and art exhibits; and as such, students will be expected to meet outside of the listed seminar schedule.  Course work will include writing poetry in response to visual art, creating anti-racist museum tags for campus galleries, writing personal essay on spiritual practice, and conducting field studies in the Emory archives.",
