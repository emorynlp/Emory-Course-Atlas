This course uses a sociological lens to provide a fundamental understanding of historical and modern-day waves of global immigration to the US. Throughout the semester, we will cover various topics generally covered in the sociology of immigration, including: (1) the role of citizenship laws and immigration policies in the categorization, displacement, and surveillance of immigrants, refugees, and asylees; (2) classical and contemporary theories of assimilation, transnationalism, and racialization used by sociologists to understand how immigrants adapt to their new context; and (3) waves of immigration to the US from the mid-19th century to the present 21st century, focusing on the integration experiences of 'old' immigrants from Europe and 'new' immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America, and Asia.",
