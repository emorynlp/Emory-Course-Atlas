Genomic epidemiology is an increasingly important approach to studying disease risks in populations. This course will introduce the basic genetic principles as they apply to the identification of genetic variations associated with disease; illustrate the population and quantitative genetic concepts that are necessary to study the relationship between genetic variation and disease variation in populations; and provide hands-on experience to address the analytical needs for conducting genomic epidemiologic research. Studentswill gain experience with R and PLINK using high dimensional genetic data.",
