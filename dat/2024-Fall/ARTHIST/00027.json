This course will introduce these questions and a selection of the imaging and analytical methods used to explore them. We will apply these methods to object(s) in the Carlos Museum collection. Case studies will serve as models for our investigative process. In-class workshops will provide practical experiences with art materials and examination methods. We will also consider ways to document and communicate the data we collect through our examination, imaging, and analysis of museum objects.",
