Ligorio, one of the leading figures in 16th century Roman humanism, based his reconstruction on a close scrutiny of surviving monuments, like the Colosseum or the Pantheon, but also on evidence from ancient coins, texts and inscriptions.   In addition, Ligorio  had access to much archaeological material that is now lost. Emory owns a very rare edition of Ligorio's map, now housed in the Rose Manuscript, Archives and Rare Book Library.   This course will consider the history and topography of the ancient city and investigate individual monuments featured on the map and compare Ligorio's reconstructions and the evidence he was using with current scholarly assessments. We will also be exploring related materials in the rare book library including Giovanni Battista Piranesi's Le Antichit√° Romane.  We will be working closely with ECDS on our digital platform \"Views of Rome\" and students will be developing new entries for or the digitized  map.\nArt History major/minor: Division I",
