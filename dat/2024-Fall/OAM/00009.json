    "course_description": "This course allows students to develop skills to interpret available evidence & gather evidence when it doesn't already exist. These skills will help students make personal/life decisions to get where they want to be, make professional decisions that benefit a team or organization, & demonstrate problem solving skills to future employers. Class will consist of discussions, interactive exercises, & projects. Topics include your brain's power & its limits, leveraging available evidence around us (restaurant reviews, social media likes, political polls, & more), using evidence to make life decisions (where to live, how to spend your money, what job to take), using evidence to make professional decisions (what strategy to adopt, should I start my own business), & methods for gathering evidence to persuade various audiences. Skills gained in this class will be valuable for those interested in consulting or leadership (in any field), or who are simply curious about living their best life.",
