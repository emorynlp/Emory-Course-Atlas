    "course_description": "This course introduces students to the main trends and works of Arabic literature (written originally in Arabic and available in English translation) in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The geographic span of the course stretches across the entirety of MENA (Middle East and North Africa), from Morocco in the west to Iraq in the east. The literary texts included in this course will be analyzed and discussed against the backdrop of important political and socio-cultural events and developments throughout MENA, including colonialism, decolonization, feminism, youth culture & activism, and the so-called Arab Spring. Thus, the course will help students develop a perception of literature not only as written word, but also as a compelling way of understanding the world. It will further assist students to engage with MENA cultures critically by analyzing how literary works create meaning(s). Knowledge of Arabic is not required to enroll in the course.",
