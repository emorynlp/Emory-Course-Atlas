    "class_notes": "Joan Didion writes, \"we tell ourselves stories in order to live.\" In this course, we will focus on the structure of narrative--how different writers tell stories and how they explore the limits of what shape a narrative can take. We will explore the phenomena of deeply unreliable narrators, of authors who become obsessed with the stories they tell, of how suspenseful narrative affects the body, of visual storytelling in film, of how conventions of popular culture genres can be recombined in startling ways. We will see stories where the real and the unreal are hard to distinguish, stories that work to expose layers and layers of meaning around a single event.\n \nRequirements: Four papers including a reflective essay, daily reading quizzes, two presentations, participation.\n \nTexts: Christie, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd; Otsuka, When the Emperor Was Divine, Yu, Interior Chinatown; Machado, In the Dream House, Johnson, The Feather Thief; This is a Robbery (film); Gadsby, Douglas (standup comedy).",
