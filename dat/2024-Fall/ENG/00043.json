We will examine how Black women writers have grappled with issues of race, gender, identity, sexuality and citizenship, as well as how forms of literary audacity function within and across these works. As such, we will interrogate texts at the levels of formal, or aesthetic production, their political and social valences, and their cultural receptions and afterlives. We will ask what constitutes Black women's audacity (in all its registers: loudness, boldness, spunk, grit, defiance, sassiness, unconventionality, etc.) in the public imaginary.",
