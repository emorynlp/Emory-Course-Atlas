We will read this literature in relation to both historical and contemporary concerns. How do Native women writers deploy diverse literary styles? How do they illuminate Indigenous women's experiences with colonization, sexual violence, and intergenerational trauma as well as with resistance, healing, and empowerment? What can we all learn by centering the experiences and voices of Native women?",
