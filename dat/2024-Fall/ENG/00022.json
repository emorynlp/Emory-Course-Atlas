    "class_notes": "This course will explore the overlay of language and politics on an island where even what you call a place--is it the North of Ireland or Northern Ireland - implies a political stance. Reading both Irish literature in English and Irish-language literature in translation, we will discuss how writers of poetry, plays, and fiction have imagined - and contributed to - cultural and political phenomena including the Irish Revival, the Easter Rising, the Troubles, and the feminist movement. \nThe writers we study are likely to include W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, James Joyce, Seamus Heaney, Claire Keegan, and Doireann Ní Ghríofa. In addition to informal and analytic writing, students will develop a research project in the splendid archives and manuscript collections of Emory's Rose Library.",
