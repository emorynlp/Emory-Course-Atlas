    "class_notes": "This course will equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary for designing and instructing a seminar that introduces first-year students at Emory to the practices of university-level writing. You will learn how those practices may be presented and scaffolded so that students can approach academic inquiry and composition in a tangible and enthusiastic manner. In doing so, you will also compare methods of responding to and evaluating student writing, design low- and high-stakes assignments, and explore elements of multimodal composition. Before turning to these more practical pedagogical matters, we will first develop a theoretical foundation of concepts drawn from rhetoric and composition, critical theory, and pedagogical debates about the status of 'argument' and 'standard academic English,' among other subjects. The course will also provide ample opportunities for students to consider contemporary challenges in writing pedagogy (such as artificial intelligence) and how their research as literary scholars offers insights into writing pedagogy and the experiences of undergraduate writers.",
