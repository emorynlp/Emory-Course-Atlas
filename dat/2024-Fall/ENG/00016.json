In this course, we will delve back into three general literary trends of the past two centuries (detective fiction, realism, and modernism,), consider how their techniques and structures are integrated and adapted by contemporary, aesthetically ambitious digital games. Building on our knowledge of both literary works and contemporary games, we will go on to collaboratively develop our own simple narrative games, with both a text-based and first-person 3D interface.",
