Both textile production and pharmacology offer pathways for investigating the relationship between cultural norms, technologies of production, ancient ecosystems and the ideologies of gender, identity, political power, and historical moment; ritual practices from the magical world, including spinning disks, nighttime endeavors, and mythological exempla help us connect the work of mortal women with their legendary counterparts. The technologies and rituals associated with spinning, winding, and weaving and other ancient tecnh not only persist in quotidian practice, they, along with their various associations (real and metaphorical) with witchcraft, women, and women's work take on new cultural significance. Early in the Christian Middle Ages, the Virgin Mary and her womb become associated with the arts of spinning and weaving; in the arts of the emerging cities of the later European Middle Ages, representations of the instruments and techniques of weaving emerge as a means thinking about relation between the arts and society. Beginning with anthropological models of witchcraft and textiles that shed light on human foundations, this course will also explore selected moments in a long history wherein that nexus becomes freighted with a particular cultural and/or social significance.",
