This course offers a comparative study of Black Atlantic masquerade traditions in initiation ceremonies, street festivals, carnivals, and funerary rites. Employing a material culture approach, we explore particularly \"festive\" sites such as the sacred city of Ile-Ife, Nigeria, which hosts festivals nearly 360 days of the year, a Caribbean carnival-capital in Jacmel, Haiti, and New Orleans traditions of Mardi Gras Indians and jazz funerals. Students will gain concrete skills in visual art analysis, becoming versed in art history, religion, anthropology, and museum studies. Ultimately, students will gain familiarity with numerous Africana parades, masquerades, funerals, and carnivals, and analyze the role of masks and art implements in private ritual ceremonies as well as public festivals.",
