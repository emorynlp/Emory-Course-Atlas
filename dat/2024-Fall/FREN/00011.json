Nouvet / TTh 2:30-3:45pm\nContent:  To see oneself reflected in a mirror may seem to be a simple experience: there, in the mirror, one sees an image of one's \"self\" as a single and stable unity, closed onto itself, distinct from all others and the surrounding world. Psychoanalysis and art both question the apparent simplicity of this perception by highlighting the status of the \"ego\" as an imaginary and even alienating construction and extending the notion of the mirror. The other can indeed function as a mirror of sorts in which \"I\" sees its \"self\" reflected in various ways ranging from love to hate.  As we shall see, 20th and 21st century artists working in different genres and media (poetry, theater, novel, painting, video) propose a much more complex and fluid conception of subjectivity by blurring the distinctions between the self and the other or the self and the world. \nTexts may include:\n-\tLacan: The Mirror Stage as Formative of the Function of the I\n-\tWinnicott: \"Mirror-Role of Mother and Family in Child Development.\"-      In Playing and Reality\n-\tFreud: On Narcissism [selections]\n-\tOvide: \"Narcisse et Echo\" in Metamorphoses\n-       Eluard: [selections of poems]\n-\tMichaux: [selection of poems]\n-       Genet: Les bonnes \n-\tLouis-René des Forêts: Les grands moments d'un chanteur\n-\tMasson: Torrential Self-portrait [painting]\n-\tMiró: Self-portrait [painting]\n-\tBill Viola: The Reflecting Pool (1979) [video]",
