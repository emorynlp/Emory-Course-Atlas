Students will bring their own interdisciplinary interests and choose their own creative tools.  In this way, business students can explore the birth of The Coca-Cola Company or explore the roots of the industrial revolution in the post-Civil War South.  Pre-med students can explore the story of the creation of Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital by an immigrant Jewish doctor.   Religion students will trace the changes that immigration to America wrought on European Reform and Orthodox religious practice.  Students exploring civil and human rights will explore Atlanta's first integrated neighborhood of freed slaves living side by side with immigrant Jews.  Environmental Studies students will make interactive maps and  explore the impact of the interstate highway.   In this Choose-Your-Own-Adventure course, students will teach each other and every form of expertise will inform the class.)\n(Students will create a group art exhibition informed by archival research and city walks. Photographers and filmmakers will use cameras.  The poets and creative writers will use words.  The dancers will use their feet.  Musicians will make soundscapes.  Painters, printmakers, and sculptors will make studio art.  Digital artists will make projected artworks.  Choose your favorite artistic forms to explore, or try something completely new.)",
