Students in this course will analyze Jewish sources and subjects to study slavery as a world-historical phenomenon in one of the pre-eminent Jewish communities of the premodern world: medieval Cairo in Islamic Egypt. Egyptian Jews preserved hundreds of records that illuminate the history of slavery. Jews in Cairo purchased slaves from Nubia, India, and Europe. Egyptian rabbis, including the polymath Moses Maimonides, wrote copiously about the Jewish laws of slavery as well as the Jewish men who sometimes defied these regulations. Recurring themes in this course include violence and enslavement; gender and sex; child slavery; slavery law; and the experiences of enslaved and freed people.\nThere will be no exams. There will be daily readings, seminar discussions, and a few short papers. In lieu of a final, students will have a choice of projects that use digital storytelling, creative writing, or another format to illuminate an aspect of this history that they choose to explore in greater depth and detail.",
