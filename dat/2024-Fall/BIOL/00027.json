We will begin with written science communication, crafting a fellowship application for the National Science Foundation. We will conclude with oral and visual communication, including giving engaging slide-based talks, compelling data presentation, accessibility considerations, and communication for a non-scientific audience. The course will involve multiple rounds of feedback and iteration on deliverables (e.g. fellowship, presentation), and may involve a considerable amount of time outside of class, especially during the first half of the semester. Enrollment is by instructor permission only. Contact Dr. Leila Rieder at leila.rieder@emory.edu for permission.",
