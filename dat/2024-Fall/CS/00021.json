In this course, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and apply them to a variety of tasks. You will learn about multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, transformers, generative models (VAE/GAN), back-propagation and stochastic gradient descent, activation functions, Xavier initialization, Adam optimizer, Dropout, BatchNorm, deep reinforcement learning, and more.",
