Although we will review some undergraduate level material, we will instead emphasize reading and experimentation at a level appropriate for the initiation of research. This course will have both theoretical and practical content. As course highlights, students will be expected to implement and analyze the performance of a fundamental data structure, starting with a close reading of the original research paper.",
