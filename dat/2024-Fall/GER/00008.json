Forced exile, the loss of home, family, friends, work, and/or livable environmental conditions are the reality for a significant proportion of the global population.\nThrough the lenses of different genres such as reportage, memoir, essay, novella, and film, this class explores the cultural productions of exile by German-Jewish writers who had to leave Germany due to Nazism in the 1930s. What thoughts, perspectives, and analyses on the rise of fascism did these writers develop? How did they conceive of their tasks as writers in exile? How did they make sense of and meaning from exile? How were forced migrations organized? What support networks were available to Jewish refugees? Special attention will be given to writers who were exiled to the Americas and to the ways in which relations of class, race, gender, and political affiliations intersect regarding their displacement from Germany and their resettlement elsewhere.",
