Through readings from the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, we will aim to develop broad, integrative and critical thinking about global environmental problems that require many kinds of knowledge to adequately recognize and address. As we work to acquire literacy in current sustainability issues and debates, we will discuss recent books and articles that relate to issues such as environmental stress, climate change and climate action, intergenerational justice, healthy agriculture, our \"ecological footprint,\" what the \"Anthropocene\" age means, and, ultimately, what it will take for human civilizations to continue to thrive.\n   We approach this vital subject through a combination of short lectures and informed discussion.",
